In this playbook, I explained an approach to running an architecture practice in larger organizations. This playbook aims to share my approach to running an IT architecture practice in larger organizations based on my experience as Chief Architect at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta. I called this approach "grounded architecture," highlighting the need for any architecture function to stay well-connected to all levels of an organization and led by data. 

Grounded Architecture has two main parts:
* **Structure**, defining elements you need to have to run Grounded Architecture practice, and
* **Reflections**, a set of my considerations and guiding principles that can help put the ideas of Grounded Architecture into practice.

The structure of the Grounded Architecture consisting of three elements:
* The Data Foundation,
* The People Pillar,
* The Architecture Activities Platform.

The *Data Foundation* ensures that architects can make data-informed decisions based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape.

The *People Pillar* is another essential element of Grounded Architecture. A strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact.

Lastly, the *Architecture Activities Platform*  defines a set of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging data and people pillars to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.

As a part of my work on Grounded Architecture, I also provided key lessons I learned while developing ideas of Grounded Architecture in practice, grouped into two parts:

* [Being an Architect](#being-architect):
  * [Architects as Superglue](#superglue)
  * [Skills](#skills)
  * [Impact](#impact)
  * [Leadership](#leadership)
  * [Architects' Career Paths](#career)
* [Doing Architecture](#doing-architecture):
  * [Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](#culture-map)
  * [Managing Organization Complexity: Six Simple Rules](#six-simple-rules)
  * [Product Development and The Build Trap](#product-development)
  * [Architecture Governance: Mandates, Taxation, Nudge](#flexible-governance)
  * [Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options](#economics)

When Grounded Architecture is in place, it can have a significant [positive impact](#impact) on the functioning of an organization:

* Enable Execution of Architecture Function At Scale,
* Increase the Quality of Decision-Making with Data,
* Maximize Organizational Alignment,
* Maximize Organizational Learning, and
* Increase Architecture Function Adaptivity.

Remember that while you may borrow ideas from others, every organization is different in the end, and your approach must adapt to your context. When forming architecture functions, I always advise not to forget these [two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/):
 * "*Your architecture team’s job is to solve your biggest problems. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that.*"
 * "*Your organization has to earn its way to an effective architecture function. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems.*"

## Introduction

{width: "20%"}
![The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role by Gregor Hohpe defines architects as people that can fill a void in large enterprises: they work and communicate closely with technical staff on projects but are also able to convey technical topics to upper management without losing the essence of the message. Conversely, they understand the company's business strategy and can translate it into technical decisions that support it.](assets/images/books/software-architecture-elevator.png)

![Software Architecture: The Hard Parts is structured as a narrative about a team breaking down a faulty outdated](assets/images/books/hard-parts.png)
monolithic application into a modern microservices-based architecture. The authors compare different aspects of how a
monolithic architecture might have been written to do something in the past, then how a modern microservice architecture
could do the same thing today, offering advice and approaches for effective tradeoff analysis when refactoring a large
monolith app.

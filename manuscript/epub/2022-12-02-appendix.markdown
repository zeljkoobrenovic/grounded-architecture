As we bring this book to a close, I would like to equip you with a helpful appendix. These resources have proven vital in my journey as an IT architect and have reminded me about what I always need to know about crucial aspects of IT practice. I routinely refer back to them and carry them in my practitioner "backpack," so I added their summaries in the appendix.

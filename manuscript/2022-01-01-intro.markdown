This book aims to share my approach to running an IT architecture practice in larger organizations based on my experience as Chief Architect at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta. I called this approach "grounded architecture," highlighting the need for any IT architecture function to stay well-connected to all levels of an organization and led by data.

Grounded Architecture has two main parts:
* **Structure**, where you will learn which elements you need to create in an organization to run a Grounded Architecture practice, and
* **Reflections**, where you will learn guiding principles that can help you put the ideas of Grounded Architecture into practice.

The figure bellow shows the structure of the Grounded Architecture consisting of three elements:
* [Data Pillar](#data),
* [People Pillar](#people),
* [Architecture Activities Platform](#activities-platform).

The *[Data Pillar](#data)* ensures that architects' decisions are data-informed, based on an up-to-date and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape.

The *[People Pillar](#people)* represents a strong network of people doing architecture across the organization that is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact.

Lastly, the *[Architecture Activities Platform](#activities-platform)* defines a set of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging data and people pillars to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.

As a part of my work on Grounded Architecture, I also provide key lessons I learned while developing ideas of Grounded Architecture in practice, grouped into two parts:

* [Being an Architect](#being-architect):
  * [Architects as Superglue](#superglue)
  * [Skills](#skills)
  * [Impact](#impact)
  * [Leadership](#leadership)
  * [Architects' Career Paths](#career)
* [Doing Architecture](#doing-architecture):
  * [Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](#culture-map)
  * [Managing Organization Complexity: Six Simple Rules](#six-simple-rules)
  * [Product Development and The Build Trap](#product-development)
  * [Architecture Governance: Mandates, Taxation, Nudge](#flexible-governance)
  * [Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options](#economics)

The rest of this book will explain in detail the grounded architecture approach. In this section, I want to tell a few things about my motivation to write this book.

## What Will you Learn?

The three parts of the book (Structure, Being Architecture, and Doing Architecture) correspond to the aspects of work of Chief Architects or Heads of Architecture that need to set up and run modern IT architecture practices:

* Create organizational and technical structures to  support architecture work,
* Define architecture roles and responsibilities, skills, and career paths,
* Operate effective architecture practice in complex multicultural organizations.

I invite you to read this book from beginning to end, following the progression from data and basic structures to management and organizational topics. However, you can also browse the text and start reading whatever interests you. I use many illustrations to create memorable pictures that you can associate with discussed topics, making the book usable across your organization as a coffee table book.

I have organized my lessons and insights in a form that, if you recognize the problems and are inspired by solutions, could use as a high-level "playbook" about how to work as an architect or run an architecture practice. I also provide more concrete tips on each discussed topic, finishing each section with questions you should consider when addressing these topics.

This book is not technical. We will not discuss the details of public cloud design patterns, security, reliability, how to optimize computer loads, or select the proper data storage. As a modern architect, you will need these skills, of course, but there are already many great resources for them. This book is about expanding your horizons to apply your technical skills in complex organizations. Or to broaden your horizons as a head or manager of architects, to organize and support architects to use their technical skills more effectively as a team.

## Is This A Proven Method?

Like with many similar books, you may be disappointed if you are looking for a scientifically proven "method" of running a modern architecture practice. This book is personal and opinionated, building on my daily experiences as an architect and running an architecture practice. While subjective, I believe this book provides valuable insights for IT architects, their managers, and people working with architects. I invite others to share the lessons they have learned similarly. Even if opinionated and limited in scope, such practical reflections based on concrete examples have much more value for practitioners than abstract debates, formal methods, or academic analyses.

While not scientific, my Grounded Architecture approach builds and borrows many ideas successfully applied in practice. Gregor Hohpe's [Architecture Elevator](https://architectelevator.com/) view of architecture has heavily inspired my work. In many ways, my work reflects the lessons learned from implementing Gregor's ideas in practice. Gregor described modern architects' functions as aligning organization and technology, reducing friction, and charting transformation journeys. Such modern architects ride the Architect Elevator from the penthouse, where the business strategy is set, to the engine room, where engineers implement enabling technologies.

In my quest to define modern architectural roles, I used Staff+ Engineering jobs as an inspiration for the development of architects. Tanya Reilly's book [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/) and Will Larson's book [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/) are a helpful guide in defining the responsibilities of architects. The Staff-plus engineering roles provide excellent examples for the development of modern architects.

Many other sources have influenced my work. Some of them are in the [Bookshelf section](#bookshelf).

## A Bit of Personal History

The work presented in this book builds on several years of my experience. Most of this work results from my current work as a Chief Architect at AVIV Group and previous works as a Principal Architect for eBay Classifieds and Adevinta.

Another vital part of my experience that shaped this book was my earlier experience as a consultant and analyst at the Software Improvement Group. I've learned the value and pragmatics of data-informed decision-making. As a spin-off of this work, I've also built a tool called [Sokrates](sokrates.dev), which enable efficient and pragmatic extraction of data about technology and organization from source code. This work has directly influenced my view on the architecture [data pillar](#data).

My experience as a CTO of [Incision](https://incision.care), a startup, has helped me better understand the difficulties and pragmatics of creating and running an IT organization.

Lastly, my experience as a researcher at [Dutch Center for Computer Science and Mathematics (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) and [Eindhoven Technical University (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/) provided me with a valuable background to do rigorous data analyses and research. From this research period, I want to highlight a collection of essays [Design Instability](https://design-instability.com/) I co-authored with Erik Stolterman, where we connected experiences of designing/architecting in three disciplines: classical design, UX design, and software engineering. This work has helped me better relate to and learn from non-technical fields necessary for architecture work.

## Why This Book?

This book generalizes my experiences in a written form. I have written these articles for two reasons. Firstly, the act of writing helps me to clarify and improve my ideas (Figure 1). As Gregor Hohpe once noted, I free up some brain cells to learn new things with every sentence I write. As nicely described by Hohpe written word has distinct advantages over the spoken word:

* it scales: you can address a broad audience without gathering them all in one (virtual) room at the same time
* it's fast to process: people read 2-3 times faster than they can listen
* it can be easily searched or versioned.

***Figure 1:** Writing a book helped me organize ideas, obtain new insights, improve principles and tools, and share the lessons learned.*

Second, by generalizing and putting my experiences on paper, I hope to create more usable materials to help others in similar situations. I also expect helpful feedback from a broader community.

## A Part of the Bigger Picture: A Trilogy in Four Parts

This book is a part of the [collection of open-source tools and resources](https://obren.io/) I have built in the past ten years to help me in architectural work (Figure 2).

![](assets/images/arch/obren_io_vertical.png)
***Figure 2:** Grounded Architecture is a part of the collection of open-source tools and resources I have built in the past ten years to help me in architectural work.*

The other resources include:

* [**Sokrates**](https://sokrates.dev): an open-source polyglot code analysis tool that implements my vision of documenting and analyzing software architectures of complex systems. Sokrates provides a pragmatic, inexpensive way to extract rich data from source code repositories. Sokrates can help you understand your code by making the size, complexity, and coupling of software and people interactions and team topologies visible.
* [**Productivity Tools**](https://obren.io/tools): for years I have been building simple personal productivity tools.
* [**359° Overview of Tech Trends**](https://www.obren359.com/) is my collection of knowledge resources with podcasts, and videos from over 20 authoritative, high-quality sources (IEEE, ACM, GOTO Conf, SE Radio, Martin Fowler's site, Ph.D. Theses). Architects need to learn fast, and finding good knowledge sources is difficult.

You can find more details about these tools at my homepage **[obren.io](https://obren.io/)**.

## Who Should Read This Book?

When writing this book, I had a broad audience in my mind. The article should be helpful to both technical and non-technical people. The book can help IT architects to better understand their value and place in a broader organization. I also hope the articles show the less-technical audience the benefits of staying close to and well-connected with the technologists.

## The Structure of the Book

I have organized the book into several main parts. In the introductory part, I describe the context in which my ideas have developed. 

In the second part, I discuss the Grounded Architecture structure describing its three elements: the data pillar, the people pillar, and the Architecture Activities Platform. 

In the third part, I talk about the Reflections of Grounded Architecture, grouped int to sections: Being Architect and Doing Architecture. 

I conclude with a summary and pointers to external resources for those who want to explore more.

The [bookshelf](#bookshelf) section shows many other books and resources that have influenced my approach and ideas.

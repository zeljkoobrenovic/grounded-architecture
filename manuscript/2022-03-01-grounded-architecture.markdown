A> **KEY POINTS:**
A> * I introduce three elements of Grounded Architecture Framework: Architectural Analytics, Collaborative Networks, and The Operating Model as an approach to setting organizational structures for a modern IT architecture practice.
A> * Prioritizing people interactions and data over processes and tools, Grounded Architecture aims to connect an architecture practice to all organizational levels as an antidote to the "ivory tower" architecture.

In this part, I will briefly introduce the Grounded Architecture framework. I chose the term "Grounded Architecture" to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is **avoid having an "ivory tower" an architecture practice** disconnected from the organization. This disconnection is a real danger in a [fast-moving, global, and diverse setting](#context). 

The Grounded Architecture framework is designed to be a **practical solution.** It aims to be **deeply rooted** in the organization, prioritizing **people's interactions** and **data** over processes and tools. The goal is to connect an architecture practice to all parts and levels of the organization, serving as a practical antidote to the 'ivory tower' architecture. In this part of the ebook, I will delve into the framework's structure and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Grounded Architecture framework is an approach to setting organizational structures for an architecture practice, and it has three elements:

* Architectural Analytics,
* Collaborative Networks,
* The Operating Model.

***Figure 1:** The Grounded Architecture framework.*

*Architectural Analytics* is **a system of tools and resources** that enables architects to make **data-informed decisions** based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape. [Architectural Analytics section](#analytics) provides more details.

*Collaborative Networks* **connect all the people** doing architecture across the organization. Thse networks are crucial to ensure that an architecture practice has any **tangible impact**. The [Collaborative Networks section](#people) provides more details.

Lastly, the *Operating Model* defines:
* **[General Principles](#operating-model)**: I've defined several **general guidelines** on directing architects to do everything an architecture practice typically does, leveraging Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.

* **[Cooperation-Based Operating Model: Six Simple Rules](#six-simple-rules)**: Grounded Architecture is particularly well-suited for organizations organized based on cooperation. As businesses grow increasingly complex, the importance of cooperation within organizational structures cannot be overstated. The "Six Simple Rules" framework emphasizes that successful organizations leverage their members' collective judgment and cooperation. By fostering a culture of collaboration, organizations can better utilize their capabilities to address and resolve complex problems.

* **[IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates](#governance)**: Governance in technology is a critical aspect of any operating model. I propose a governance model incorporating three styles: nudging, taxation, and mandates. Nudging involves subtle policy shifts that guide behavior without restricting choices, while taxation uses economic incentives to encourage desired outcomes. Mandates and bans provide direct regulations to ensure compliance and standardization. This multifaceted approach allows for flexible and effective governance, balancing innovation with control and ensuring technological initiatives align with broader organizational goals.

While I elaborately discuss many faces of the operating model, I want to emphasize that any Operating Model is only relevant if there are **healthy Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks**. Without data and people connections, an operating model leads to an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.

Now that we've completed the high-level Grounded Architecture tour let's examine the specifics.

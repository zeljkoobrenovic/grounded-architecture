<b>Sokrates</b>: Sokrates is a tool I built to implement my vision of documenting and analyzing software architectures of complex systems.
Sokrates provides a pragmatic, inexpensive way to extract rich data from source code repositories.
Sokrates can help you understand your code by making visible the size, complexity, and coupling of software and all people interactions and team topologies.

A> **KEY POINTS:**
A> * I identified the following needs that an architecture function should support: Executing At Scale, Adaptivity, Improving the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, and Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning.

Grounded Architecture emerged as a necessity in response to our [intricate and multifaceted challenges](#context). The Grounded Architecture framework was designed to address these specific challenges. By moving away from manual processes and embracing automation, data-driven decision-making, and adaptive frameworks, we aimed to create a **more resilient and effective** architectural practice. 

## Goals

Here's a detailed breakdown of the goals we set to revamp our approach.

### Goal 1: Executing At Scale

Our organizations were like a bustling city with hundreds of teams and thousands of projects, each with its own unique complexity and requirements. Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches to architecture practice simply couldnâ€™t keep up with this dynamic environment. We needed a system that could support this vast and varied ecosystem. Grounded Architecture was designed to **handle such diversity at scale,** ensuring that teams and projects received the tailored support they needed without being bogged down by rigid processes.

### Goal 2: Adaptivity

In our dynamic environments, significant change is not just frequent; it's expected. Whether these changes are organic, like evolving business needs, or inorganic, like mergers and acquisitions, our architecture must be **able to adapt swiftly**. Grounded Architecture was crafted to be flexible and responsive, allowing us to pivot quickly in response to new challenges and opportunities. This adaptability ensures that our architectural framework remains relevant and effective, no matter how the organizational landscape shifts.

### Goal 3: Increasing Quality of Decisions with Data

Relying on gut feelings or individual opinions is always insufficient and risky when dealing with operations at scale. Decisions need to be based on solid data to **ensure accuracy and reliability.** Grounded Architecture aims to incorporate advanced tools and mechanisms to support data-driven decision-making. By leveraging data and analytics, we can move away from subjective opinions and towards objective, evidence-based decisions. This approach enhances the quality of our decisions and ensures that they are consistent and aligned with our organizational goals.

### Goal 4: Maximizing Organizational Alignment

In a global, fast-moving organization, misalignment can quickly become the norm. Different teams and departments might pursue conflicting objectives, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. Grounded Architecture aims to **serve as a cohesive force,** promoting alignment across the entire organization. Providing a clear, unified framework helps to minimize misalignments. It facilitates all parts of the organization working towards common goals. This alignment is crucial for maintaining efficiency and avoiding the chaos that can arise from disparate efforts.

### Goal 5: Maximizing Organizational Learning

Staying current with emerging technologies and industry trends is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. Still, it can be challenging when dealing with the demands of legacy systems. Grounded Architecture is designed to facilitate continuous learning and growth. It supports the rapid adoption of new technologies and encourages **ongoing education and training.** By keeping the organization up-to-date with the latest developments, Grounded Architecture aims to ensure we always have the best tools and knowledge to drive innovation and improvement.

Grounded Architecture aims to transform a typically cumbersome, manual-process-driven practice into a streamlined, adaptive, and learning-focused powerhouse. 

## Questions to Consider

Knowing what goals architecture practice needs to support in your organization is crucial to defining structures and measuring your impact. Some of the plans may be universally applicable. Others may be unique to your context. Ask yourself the following questions:

* *What is the scale of your architecture function? Does your scale require special measures to ensure your architecture practice efficient operations?*
* *What are the key decisions you need to make? Do you have the data to base your decisions?*
* *How aligned are units in your organizations? How much friction is there? How can architecture function help?*
* *How much is your organization learning? How is the learning supported?*
* *How stable is your organization? How likely is it that significant changes will occur in your organization?*

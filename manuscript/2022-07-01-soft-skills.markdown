In the following sections, I introduce several resources that I use as inspiration for developing the soft skills of IT architects. I focus on topics not typically covered in IT architecture literature, drawing inspiration from social, behavioral, and management sciences:

* **[The Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](#culture-map)**: In multinational organizations, architects will work with many different cultures. The work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, is a beneficial tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from various cultures and backgrounds.
* **[Effective Communication](communication)**: A summary of several resources to help you communicate more effectively, provide good feedback, and lead tough conversations.
* **[Leadership](#leadership)**: My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet's work and Netflix's valued behaviors.

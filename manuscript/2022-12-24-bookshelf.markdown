The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role by Gregor Hohpe defines architects as people that can fill a void in large enterprises: they work and communicate closely with technical staff on projects but are also able to convey technical topics to upper management without losing the essence of the message. Conversely, they understand the company's business strategy and can translate it into technical decisions that support it.

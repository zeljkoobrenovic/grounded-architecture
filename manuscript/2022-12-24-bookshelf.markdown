A> **KEY POINTS:**
A> * I provide an overview of the background work for you to probe further, linking several external resources inspiring my work.
A> * I grouped the resources in the following sections: Introductions, Soft Skills, Business & Strategy, and Hard Skills.




## Introductions





![](assets/images/software-architecture-elevator.webp)

The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role by Gregor Hohpe defines architects as people that can fill a void in large enterprises: they work and communicate closely with technical staff on projects but are also able to convey technical topics to upper management without losing the essence of the message. Conversely, they understand the company's business strategy and can translate it into technical decisions that support it.











![](assets/images/books/spotify.png)

SE Radio: On Architecture: for those interested in IT Architecture, I've created a curated Spotify playlist of Software Engineering Radio Episodes focusing on Architecture.









![](assets/images/books/for-developers.png)

architecture, specifically aimed at software developers.

![](assets/images/books/hard-parts.jpg)


Software Architecture: The Hard Parts is structured as a narrative about a team breaking down a faulty outdated
monolithic application into a modern microservices-based architecture. The authors compare different aspects of how a
monolithic architecture might have been written to do something in the past, then how a modern microservice architecture
could do the same thing today, offering advice and approaches for effective tradeoff analysis when refactoring a large
monolith app.





![](assets/images/books/just-enough-software-architecture.jpeg)


Just Enough Software Architecture by George Fairbanks is an approachable and comprehensive book.

effective architectures for information systems.





## Career Development





![](assets/images/books/staff-engineer-or.jpg)

The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly. Similar to my view of architects the staff engineer's path allows engineers to contribute at a high level as role models, driving big projects, determining technical strategy, and raising everyone's skills.

![](assets/images/books/staff-engineer.jpeg)

Staff Engineer by Will Larson, defined technical leadership beyond the management track. I share many of the views presented in this book regarding development and skills of architects.

## Hard Skills

This section is heavily influenced by Gregor Hohpe's
article [The Architect’s Path (Part 2 - Bookshelf)](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/)





![](assets/images/books/clean-code.jpeg)

Clean Code by Bob Martin. Good software starts with good code, and good code is clean. The basics of naming, functions that do one thing well, and formatting.




![](assets/icons/notes.png)






![](assets/images/books/refactoring.jpeg)

Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler. Good software evolves, gains entropy, and is then restructured. Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.

![](assets/images/books/ddd.png)


Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans promotes the idea that that to develop software for a complex domain, we need
to build Ubiquitous Language that embeds domain terminology into the software systems that we build. DDD stresses
defining models in software, and evolving them during the life of the software product.






![](assets/images/books/release-it.jpg)


Release It! (2nd Edition) by Mike Nygard’s is about architecture design and decisions regarding stability and how
to build "cynical" software. Besides the well known stability patterns like circuit breakers and bulkheads the book

covering more process oriented questions like deployments or handling security.






![](assets/images/books/data-intensive.png)


Designing Data Intensive Systems by Martin Kleppmann is a mini-encyclopedia of modern data engineering. Not a
practice or a cookbook for a particular Big Data, NoSQL or newSQL product, the book lays down the principles of current
distributed big data systems. Covers replication, partitioning, linearizability, locking, write skew, phantoms,
transactions, event logs, and much more.





![](assets/images/books/thinking-in-systems.png)

Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows describes a system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.

![](assets/images/books/culture-maps.jpeg)

The Culture Map: Decoding How People Think, Lead, and Get Things Done Across Cultures: provides a framework for handling intercultural differences in business and illustrates how different cultures perceive the world. Awareness of intercultural differences is crucial for the success of an architect in an international setting. It helps us understand these differences and, in doing so, improves our ability to react to specific behaviors that might have once seemed strange.












![](assets/images/books/turn-ship-around.jpeg)

Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet:  Around reveals the story of how one United States Navy captain managed to turn a dissatisfied submarine crew into a formidable and respected team.

![](assets/images/books/nudge.webp)

Nudge by Richard Thaler draws on research in psychology and behavioral economics to define libertarian paternalism as an active engineering of choice architecture. The book also popularised the concept of a nudge, a choice architecture that predictably alters people's behavior without restricting options or significantly changing their economic incentives.

![](assets/images/books/no-rules-rules.webp)

No Rules Rules by Erin Meyer and Reed Hastings provides insights into Netflix culture. When you give low-level employees access to information that is generally reserved for high-level executives, they get more done on their own. They work faster without stopping to ask for information and approval. They make better decisions without needing input from the top.

![](assets/images/books/sowhat.webp)

The So What Strategy by Davina Stanley and Gerard Castles. Any architect has been caught at the end of a presentation when their audience, perhaps a leadership team or a Steering Committee, looks at them blankly and asks this most uncomfortable question: ‘So what?' How does that help? The book provides a pragmatic approach to answer that question in one single, powerful sentence. Or how to set yourself up so nobody asks it.

## Organization and Processes






![](assets/images/books/accelerate.jpeg)


Accelerate—acceleration is the second derivative of position (speed being the first), so if you want to move
faster you need to accelerate. Sometimes, you need to jerk the system a bit, which in fact the proper term for the third
derivative.

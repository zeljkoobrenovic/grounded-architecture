A> **KEY POINTS:**
A> * I provide an overview of the background work for you to probe further, linking several external resources inspiring my work.
A> * I grouped the resources in the following sections: Introductions, Soft Skills, Business & Strategy, and Hard Skills.




## Introductions

The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role by Gregor Hohpe defines architects as people that can fill a void in large enterprises: they work and communicate closely with technical staff on projects but are also able to convey technical topics to upper management without losing the essence of the message. Conversely, they understand the company's business strategy and can translate it into technical decisions that support it.

Software Architecture for Developers by Simon Brown is a practical, pragmatic and lightweight guide to software
architecture, specifically aimed at software developers.

Software Architecture: The Hard Parts is structured as a narrative about a team breaking down a faulty outdated
monolithic application into a modern microservices-based architecture. The authors compare different aspects of how a
monolithic architecture might have been written to do something in the past, then how a modern microservice architecture
could do the same thing today, offering advice and approaches for effective tradeoff analysis when refactoring a large
monolith app.

Software Systems Architecture by Nick and Eóin is a practitioner-oriented guide to designing and implementing
effective architectures for information systems.


## Career Development

![](assets/images/books/staff-engineer-or.jpg)

The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly. Similar to my view of architects the staff engineer's path allows engineers to contribute at a high level as role models, driving big projects, determining technical strategy, and raising everyone's skills.

Staff Engineer by Will Larson, defined technical leadership beyond the management track. I share many of the views presented in this book regarding development and skills of architects. 


## Hard Skills

This section is heavily influenced by Gregor Hohpe's
article [The Architect’s Path - Part 2 - Bookshelf](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/)

![](assets/images/books/clean-code.jpeg)

Clean Code by Bob Martin. Good software starts with good code, and good code is clean. The basics of naming, functions that do one thing well, and formatting.

![](assets/images/books/refactoring.jpeg)

Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler. Good software evolves, gains entropy, and is then restructured. Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.


* * *

{width: "20%"}
![](assets/images/books/design-patterns.webp)

Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides. Design patterns help us make balanced decisions on the design
of our code.

![](assets/images/books/building-microservices.webp)

Building Microservices (2nd Edition) by Sam Newman is a book about architectural trade-offs and considerations in
distributed system design. Very accessible.

{width: "20%"}
![](assets/images/books/fundamentals-of-software-architecture.jpeg)

Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Neal and Mark, covers soft skills, modularity, component-based thinking,
and architectural styles.


* * *

{width: "20%"}
![](assets/images/books/eip.webp)

Enterprise Integration Patterns for anyone trying to connect systems without coupling them too tightly.

![](assets/images/books/pattern-oriented-software-architecture.jpeg)

Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: one of the most comprehensive references for distributed system design.



* * *

{width: "20%"}
![](assets/images/books/evolutionary-achitectures.jpeg)

Building Evolutionary Architectures describes how to use fitness functions to guide architectural change over time. I thought the authors could have gotten a bit more our of this topic - perhaps we’ll see a second edition.

![](assets/images/books/ddd.png)

Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans promotes the idea that that to develop software for a complex domain, we need
to build Ubiquitous Language that embeds domain terminology into the software systems that we build. DDD stresses
defining models in software, and evolving them during the life of the software product.

{width: "20%"}
![](assets/images/books/release-it.jpg)

Release It! (2nd Edition) by Mike Nygard’s is about architecture design and decisions regarding stability and how
to build "cynical" software. Besides the well known stability patterns like circuit breakers and bulkheads the book
introduces foundational knowledge about running systems in production, from processes to network to security, also
covering more process oriented questions like deployments or handling security.

![](assets/images/books/data-intensive.png)

Designing Data Intensive Systems by Martin Kleppmann is a mini-encyclopedia of modern data engineering. Not a
practice or a cookbook for a particular Big Data, NoSQL or newSQL product, the book lays down the principles of current
distributed big data systems. Covers replication, partitioning, linearizability, locking, write skew, phantoms,
transactions, event logs, and much more.

![](assets/images/books/thinking-in-systems.png)

Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows describes a system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.

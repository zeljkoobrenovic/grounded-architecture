## Introduction

This simple cheatsheet serves as a reference guide for topics discussed in follow-up sections.
 
### [Context: Fast Moving Global Organizations](#context)
A> * To better understand any idea or solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which these ideas developed. 
A> * The grounded architecture approach has developed in the context of global, loosely coupled organizations that are diverse, with non-linear growth dynamics, and under transformation pressures. 
A> * More specifically, the work I present here reflects my experiences as a Chief or Principal Architect at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta.

### [Goals](#goals)
A> * I identified the following needs that an architecture function should support: Executing At Scale, Increasing the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning, Higher Adaptivity.

 
## Grounded Architecture Structure 

### [Data Pillar](#data)

A> * The architecture data pillar serves as a medium to create a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of technology landscapes of big organizations. 
A> * The data pillar provides an architecture-centric view on data about a technology landscape based on source code analyses, public cloud billing reports, vibrancy reports, or incident tickets.
A> * To facilitate creation of data pillars, I have been working on development open-source tools, such as [Sokrates](https://sokrates.dev), that can help obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories.


### [People Pillar](#people)
A> * Developing the architecture function requires having competent, empowered, and motivated architects. Any architecture function must carefully organize, empower,
    and leverage scarce architecture talent.
A> * We should not take architectural talent for granted. Architects are bridging local business, product, 
    organizational, and technology issues. Architects are difficult to hire talent as they need not only 
    in-depth technical knowledge but also domain-specific and organizational knowledge.
A> * In my work in the past few years, I was working by combining, in different forms, two teams of architects: a small 
    central architecture team and a cross-organizational distributed virtual team. 

### [Activities Platform](#activities-platform)
A> * The Architecture Activities Platform defines a set of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging data and people pillars to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.
A> * Examples of activities include: supporting teams in their daily work; tracking tech debt, defining tech debt reduction programs; performing technical due diligence; standardization of processes and documentation; defining cloud, data, and platform strategies.

## Being Architect

### [Architects as Superglue](#superglue)

A> * Architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.
A> * Architects need to be technically strong. But their unique strengths should stem from being able to relate, or glue, technical issues with business and broader issues.
A> * Superglue architects should stand on three legs: Skills, Impact, Leadership.

### [Skills](#skills)

A> * A typical skillset of an architects includes: hard (technical) skills, soft (people & social) skills, and business skills.

### [Impact](#impact)
A> * Architects' work is evaluated based the impact they've had on the organization. 
A> * Architects can make an impact via three pillars: Big-Picture Thinking, Execution, and Leveling-Up.

### [Leadership](#leadership)
A> * My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet's work and the Netflix's valued behaviors.
A> * Marquet focused on leadership and organizational management, with a particular emphasis on the principles of Intent-Based Leadership.
A> * Borrowing from Netflix's original values the following behavioral traits are crucial for architects are: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.

### [Architects' Career Paths](#career)
A> * Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background.
A> * I usually envision three tracks of seniority progression: Senior Architect, Principal Architect, and Enterprise Architect. 
A> * Hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure.  


## Doing Architecture

### [The Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](#culture-map)
A> * I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a very helpful tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from a broad array of different cultures and backgrounds.
A> * Meyer’s model contains eight scales, each representing a key area, showing how cultures vary from extreme to extreme: Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling.

### [Managing Organizational Complexity: Six Simple Rules](#six-simple-rules)
A> * Six Simple Rules emphasis that in today’s complicated business environment, you need to setup organisational structures based on cooperation. 
A> * To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating to utilize the organization's capabilities to cope with complex problems. 
A> * This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture.

### [In the Eye of the Storm: Aligning Business, Product, Technology and Organization Strategies](#storm)
A> * I want architecture always to address one of the most challenging problems our organization faces: a tension between technology, product, organization, and business functions.
A> * Architecture should ensure that conversations happen between the technical, product, organizational, and business functions. 

### [Product Development and The Build Trap](#product-development)
A> * The product trap occurs when businesses focus too much on their product’s features and functionalities, overlooking their customers’ actual needs and preferences.
A> * There are three bad product-development organizations: sales, visionary, and technology led companies, .
A> * There are several bad product manager archetypes: Mini-CEO, Waiter, and Former Project Manager.
A> * Critical elements of successful product-led companies include: Understanding Customer Needs, Adopting a Customer-Centric Approach, Executing Iterative Product Development, Aligning Business Goals with Customer Needs, Embracing Innovation and Agility, and Measuring Success.

### [Architecture Governance: Mandates, Taxation, Nudge](governance)
A> * Grounded Architecture supports governance models adaptable to organizations' complex and diverse needs. I see a technology governance model as a well-balanced hybrid of three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.
A> * By governing with mandates and bans, I mean guiding people by explicitly defining what they should or should not do.
A> * Governing with taxes is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to "pay" some form of taxes on used resources.
A> * Nudging is a form of governing where we create subtle or indirect suggestion influencing someone's behavior or decision-making without forcing them or limiting their freedom of choice.

### [Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options](#economics)
A> * Architects are frequently asked about the (economic) value of architecture or technology investments.
A> * Answering this question is a crucial skill for any senior architect. But it may be difficult to answer this seemingly harmless question concisely and convincingly to a non-technical audience.
A> * Borrowing from existing literature, I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of architecture: the return on investment metaphor and the selling options metaphor.

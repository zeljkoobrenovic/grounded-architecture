As we bring this book to a close, I would like to equip you with a helpful appendix. In this part, I outline three resources that have proven vital in my journey as an IT architect and have reminded me about what I always need to know about crucial aspects of IT practice. I routinely refer back to them and carry them in my practitioner "backpack," so I added their summaries in the appendix.

* **[EIC/ISO 25010 Standard](concepts-iso25010)** focuses on product quality and system quality models. While imperfect, this standard is a reasonably complete yet compact source for understanding software maintainability, security, reliability, and performance efficiency. 

* **[Cloud Design Patterns](concepts-cloud)** offer a mix of crucial distributed system and messaging system topics combined with modern public cloud engineering themes.

* **[Characteristics of High Performing Organizations](concepts-org)** from the 'Accelerate' book by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim is an excellent source of empirical knowledge about crucial practices of high-performing technology organizations.

* **[Building Data Foundation Website: Lean Design Patterns and Techniques (Online Only)](data-website)** a few practical tips on building lean architecture dashboards and documents (e.g., to create the data foundation) using simple, widely available tools.

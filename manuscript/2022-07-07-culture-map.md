In multinational organizations, architects will need to work with many different cultures. I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a beneficial tool to work harmoniously with people from a broad array of different cultures and backgrounds. Awareness of cultural differences is even more important for architects, as they are bridging diverse cultures and domains (technology, business, domain, organization).




Meyer’s model contains eight scales, each representing a key area, showing how cultures vary from extreme to extreme. The eight scales describe a continuum between the two ends which are diametric opposite or competing positions:

* **Communicating** – Are cultures low-context (simple, verbose, and clear), or high-context (rich deep meaning in interactions)?
* **Evaluating** – When giving negative feedback, does one give it directly or prefer being indirect and discreet?
* **Persuading** – Do people like to hear specific cases and examples or prefer detailed holistic explanations?
* **Leading** – Are people in groups egalitarian or prefer hierarchy?
* **Deciding** – Are decisions made in consensus or made top-down?
* **Trusting** – Do people base trust on how well they know each other or how well they work together?
* **Disagreeing** – Are disagreements tackled directly, or do people prefer to avoid confrontations?
* **Scheduling** – Do people see time as absolute linear points or consider it a flexible range?

The Culture Map shows positions along these eight scales for many countries. These profiles reflect the value systems of a society at large, not those of all the individuals in it, so if you plot yourself on the map, you might find that some of your preferences differ from those of your culture.

## 1. Communicating

Architects need to be [good communicators](https://architectelevator.com/strategy/complex-topics-stick/). But what do we mean when saying someone is a good communicator? The responses differ wildly from society to society.

The Evaluating scale measures a preference for frank versus diplomatic negative feedback. Evaluating is different than the Communicating scale and many countries have different positions on the two scales. According to Meyers, the French, are high-context (implicit) communicators relative to Americans. Yet they are more direct in their criticism. Spaniards and Mexicans are at the same context level, but the Spanish is much franker when providing negative feedback.

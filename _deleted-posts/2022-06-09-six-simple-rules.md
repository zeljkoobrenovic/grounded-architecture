The book [Six Simple Rules: How to Manage Complexity without Getting Complicated](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/organization/smart-simplicity/six-rules-overcoming-complexity), by  Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman, is another source of inspiration for my vision on the Architecture function. Morieux and Tollman introduced a concept of Smart Simplicity with six simple rules or strategies based on economics, game theory, and organizational sociology. These rules enable organizations to promote new behaviors and improve performance.

The book emphasis that in today’s complicated business environment, you **need to setup organisational structures based on cooperation**. To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people, which requires giving them more autonomy to act. It also depends on these people cooperating to utilize the organization's capabilities to cope with complex problems.

This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture. In this section, I will explore the connection between the ideas of Grounded Architecture and Six Simple Rules.

Six Simple rules cover two areas: autonomy and cooperation. The first three rules create the conditions for **individual autonomy and empowerment** to improve performance.

* **Understand what your people do**. Trace performance back to behaviors and how they influence overall results. Understand the context of goals, resources, and constraints. Determine how an organization’s elements shape goals, resources, and constraints.
* **Reinforce integrators**. Identify integrators—those individuals or units whose influence makes a difference in the work of others—by looking for points of tension where people are doing the hard work of cooperating. Integrators bring others together and drive processes. They work at the nexus where constraints and requirements often meet. Give integrators the power and interest to foster cooperation in dealing with complexity. Remove managerial layers that don’t add value.
* **Increase the total quantity of power**. When creating new roles in the organization, empower them to make decisions without taking power away from others. Providing a few tools simultaneously is more effective than offering many tools sequentially. Regularly enrich power bases to ensure agility, flexibility, and adaptability.

The second set of rules compels people to confront complexity and use their newfound autonomy to cooperate with others so that **overall performance, not just individual performance**, is radically improved.
* **Increase reciprocity**. Set clear objectives that stimulate mutual interest to cooperate. Make each person’s success dependent on the success of others. Eliminate monopolies, reduce resources, and create new networks of interaction.
* **Extend the shadow of the future**. Have people experience the consequences that result from their behavior and decisions. Tighten feedback loops. Shorten the duration of projects. Enable people to see how their success is aided by contributing to the success of others.
* **Reward those who cooperate**. Increase the payoff for all when they cooperate in a beneficial way. Establish penalties for those who fail to cooperate.

## Simple Rule 1: Understand What Your People Do

First rule states that you need to truly understand performance: **what people do** and **why they do it**. When you understand why people do what they do and how it drives performance, you can define the **minimum sufficient set of interventions with surgical accuracy**.

</div>

You can truly understand performance by:
* Tracing **performance back to behaviors** and how they influence and combine to produce overall results. 
* Using **observation, mapping, measurement, and discussion** to do this. 
* **Understand the context of goals, resources, and constraints** within which the current behaviors constitute rational strategies for people. 
* Finding out how your **organization’s elements** (structure, scorecards, systems, incentives, and so on) shape these goals, resources, and constraints. 

Grounded Architecture:
* Data Pillar
* Building Maps
* Connections and communities

<br>
## Simple Rule 2: Reinforce Integrators

Reinforce integrators by looking at those **directly involved in the work**, giving them **power and interest to foster cooperation in dealing with complexity** instead of resorting to the paraphernalia of overarching hierarchies, overlays, dedicated interfaces, balanced scorecards, or coordination procedures.

</div>

You can reinforce integrators by:
* **Using feelings** to identify candidates: emotions provide essential clues for the analysis because they are symptoms rather than causes. 
* Finding **operational units** those that can be **integrators among peer units** because of some particular interest or power. 
* **Removing managerial layers who cannot add value** and reinforce others as integrators by eliminating some rules and relying on observation and judgment rather than metrics whenever cooperation is involved.

Grounded Architecture:
* Superglue
* Help identifying integrators
* Supporting integrators with data and insights, and connections


<br>
## Simple Rule 3: Increase the Total Quantity of Power

Whenever you consider an **addition to** your organization’s **structure, processes, and systems**, think about **increasing the quantity of power**. Doing so may **save you from increasing complicatedness** and enable you to achieve a more significant impact with less cost. You can increase the quantity of power by enabling some functions to have an influence on new stakes that matter to others and performance.

</div>

To increase the quantiyy of power consoder the following actions:
* Whenever you are going to make a design decision that will **swing the pendulum—between center and units**, between functions and line managers, and so on—see if making some parts of the organization **benefit from new power bases** could satisfy more requirements in dealing with complexity so that you don’t have to swing the pendulum in the other direction in the future (which would only compound complicatedness with the mechanical frictions and disruptions inherent to these changes). 
* When you have to create new functions, make sure you give them the power to play their role and that this **power does not come at the expense of the power needed by others** to play theirs. 
* When you **create new tools** for managers (planning, or evaluation systems, for instance), ask yourself if these constitute **resources or constraints**. Providing a few tools simultaneously is more effective (because it creates a critical mass of power) than many tools sequentially, one after the other. 
* **Regularly enrich power bases** to ensure agility, flexibility, and adaptiveness

Grounded Architecture:
* Decision making power distribution  


<br>
## Simple Rule 4: Increase Reciprocity

In the face of business complexity, work is becoming more inter-dependent. To meet multiple and often contradictory performance requirements, **people need to rely more on each other**. They need to **cooperate directly** instead of relying on dedicated interfaces, coordination structures or procedures that only add to complicatedness.

</div>

Reciprocity is the recognition by people or units in an organization that they **have a mutual interest in cooperation** and that the success of one depends on the success of others (and vice versa). The way to create that reciprocity is by setting rich objectives and reinforcing them by:
 * **eliminating monopolies**, 
 * **reducing resources**, and 
 * **creating new networks of interaction**.


Grounded Architecture:
* Creating new networks of interaction
* Success of architecture depends on success of supported units.

## Simple Rule 5: Extend the Shadow of the Future

Increase the importance to people of **what happens tomorrow as a consequence of what they do today**. By making very simple changes you can manage complex requirements, while also removing organizational complicatedness. With the strategic alignment typical of the hard approach, these simple solutions—for instance, career paths—often come at the end of a sequence that starts by installing the most cumbersome changes: new structure, processes, systems, metrics, and so on. Simple and effective solutions are then impossible.

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>
You can extend the shadow of the future in four ways: 
* Tighten the feedback loop by making **more frequent the moments when people experience the consequence** of the fit between their contributions. 
* **Bring the end point forward**, notably, by shortening the duration of projects. 
* **Tie futures together** so that successful moves are conditioned by contributing to the successful move of others. 
* Make people **walk in the shoes they make** for others.

* Transparency and data
* Simulations and roadmaps
* Economic modeling

## Simple Rule 6: Reward Those Who Cooperate

When you cannot create direct feedback loops embedded in people’s tasks, you need **management’s intervention to close the loop**. Managers must then use the familiar tool of performance evaluation, but in a very different way. 


![](assets/images/arch/people-gac98109e9_1920.jpg)
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

To reward those who cooperate managers:
* Must **go beyond technical criteria** (putting the blame where the root cause problem originated). In dealing with the business complexity of multiple and often conflicting performance requirements, the smart organization accepts that problems in execution happen for many reasons and that the only way to solve them is to **reduce the payoff for all those people or units that fail uo cooperate in solving a problem**, even if the problem does not take place exactly in their area, and to **increase the payoff for all when units cooperate in a beneficial way**. 
* They must not blame failure, but **blame failing to help or ask for help**. 
* Instead of the elusive sophistication of balance scorecards and other counterproductive cumbersome systems and procedures, they can **use simple questions** to change the terms of the managerial conversation so that **transparency and ambitious targets become resources rather than constraints** for the individual. Managers then act as integrators by obtaining from others the cooperation that will leverage the rich information allowed by this transparency and help achieve superior results.

* Transparency about cooperation problems
* Helping people to ask for help or help others
* Supergluing

AVIV Group Architects need to have a **strong software engineering background**. A typical career path to a Senior Architect role is **via a Principal Engineer position**. In addition to meeting the requirements of a Principal Engineer role, Senior architects must have a demonstrable impact with a **broader scope** of work. They also must build a solid track record in the **key six competencies**.

## **Scope and Impact**

Architects' work is evaluated based on how much impact they've had on the organization. They must demonstrate that they: 

* **Identify, tackle and deliver on strategic problems** at the organization<br>and area levels (domain or technical areas).
* **Have a track record of deep or broad impact** on a domain, product or technology area. 
* **Deliver solutions that few others can**, either by their heavy lifting or the ability to orchestrate large group efforts. 

## **Key Competencies** 

### *Citizenship*

Citizenship means that architects should:

* **Be role models** for others in the company on both the technical and cultural front.  
* **Lead efforts** that solve **important problems** in their areas. 
* **Raise the bar** of the engineering culture across the company.
* **Contribute to the broader technical community** through tech talks, education, publications, open source projects, etc. 
* **Have influence that extends** beyond their organization and reach the industry at large.


### *Design and Architecture*

Design and architecture work of architect should focus on the most important and complex topics. Architects should:

* **Identify and solve systemic architectural problems** at the group or technical area level. Architects quickly recognize systemic problems and can **articulate possible solutions** to them.
* **Improve the definition of best practices** and architecture with deep domain knowledge at the group or technical area level. 


### *Software Engineering*

Software engineering work of architects should focus on more complex topics. Architects should:

* **Promote and/or demonstrate best-in-class** of code, documentation, testing, and monitoring practices. 
* **Solve challenging technical and/or execution problems** that few others can.

### *Execution and Results*

Architects should find pragmatic ways to deliver results in a broad context:

* **Create meaningful solutions** at the group or area levels. 
* **Break down complex problems** and deliver impactful results.  
* **Craft pragmatic plans** by considering technical, logistical, and organizational constraints. 
* Are thought leaders in their areas with problem-specific **expertise on how to deliver results**.
* Are **considered experts** across about AVIV Group’s systems or particular technologies and approaches.

### *Collaboration*

Architects should find ways ot enable other to collaborate and work better:

* **Creating alignment** and **improving collaboration** within their areas or the wider engineering organization. 
* **Collaborate meaningfully across groups** in a way that builds trust and incresses execution speed. 

### *Creating Efficiency*

* **Consistently root out inefficiencies** at the group or area level and lead the adoption of technologies and processes that **make multiple teams more efficient**.  
* See the **big picture** and work towards high leverage points for maximum impact.


## **Examples** 

The following examples are to contextualize and bring to life described competencies, **not a checklist**.

### *Citizenship Examples*

* You coordinate large-sized projects to increase the efficiency of your organization, i.e., refactoring legacy monoliths, developing build scripts or tools, refactoring old, widely-used code, leading the switch to a new task manager, etc.  
* You actively discover holes in your organization’s culture and organize efforts to fill them, i.e., starting an employee resource groups to create a community around a specific interest group; leading an effort to increase test coverage, etc. 
* You speak at engineering conferences and relay back key takeaways to your organization to guide the future roadmap.
* You frequently consult on project beyond your area’s scope. You are the go-to person for junior engineers to ask for help. You are patient and teach them how to find the answer as opposed to giving them the answer. 
* You are a leader in your area’s recruiting process and demonstrate this by conducting interviews and “sell” meetings with candidates as well as sourcing them through your professional network. 

### *Design and Architecture Examples*

* You lead or coordinate the organization-wide development and adoption of key frameworks that move the needle for multiple teams simultaneously.
* When you notice that another team in the area is struggling, you help to reroute the team roadmap, improve communication between different stakeholders, and align objectives to ensure that all services under this team’s purview function like a well-oiled machine. 
* When you identify knowledge gaps in the organization, you work with relevant stakeholders to implement and lead training programs to fill these holes.
* When teams are transitioning between different systems, you help them understand the reasoning behind this shift and how it will improve the company’s overall outcomes.
* You have an ambient awareness of how teams' work affects other systems in its orbit.
* You take the time to learn about parallel technologies (e.g., machine learning, data storage, etc.) and how they fit into the grand scheme of AVIV Group Engineering, enabling you to make thoughtful and collaborative decisions about AVIV Group’s technical future. 
* Your choice of techniques and methodologies are optimal and state-of-the-art.

### *Software Engineering Examples*

* You understand the architecture of an existing system by working closely with other engineers, and you understand how team's contribution could be effectively integrated into existing systems. 
* You anticipate outages, failovers, and other technical hiccups well in advance, ensuring that your area prepares for and/or prevents them through service updates and redesigns.
* You conduct inter-organizational research to identify novel designs where others had formerly failed. 
* Your thought process takes into account industry standards and best practices from other companies that may better suit AVIV Group’s needs.

### *Execution and Results Examples*

* Before embarking on a new project, align relevant stakeholder objectives, develop an engineering strategy, drive consensus among teams, and deliver the necessary results. 
* Execute large-scale changes such as system redesigns to increase efficiency and headroom.   
* Execute organization-wide standardizations to reduce duplication and maintain the long-term extensibility of our systems.
* Drive solutions that increase the stability and reliability of AVIV Group’s tech stack. 
* Carefully follow industry trends, technological advancements, and the practices of other companies to scrutinize the status quo of AVIV Group’s technologies.


### *Collaboration Examples*

* You lead design & architecture forums within your area.
* You can deliver results by leveraging support across multiple teams in various groupes and domains.
* You collaborate with other companies on developing or building on existing open source frameworks.


### *Creating Efficiency Examples*

* You identify large-scale opportunities to increase efficiencies and help successfully execute them. Throughout the process, you support success by developing technical roadmaps, aligning cross-functional efforts between multiple stakeholders, and leading efforts to deliver solutions that make the work of our engineers more impactful.
* You architect processes to make microservices more effectively communicate with each other by finding repeated and/or unnecessary interaction patterns and marshalling/unmarshalling data in our system.
* You understand the macro-level cost of operating our systems, and develop solutions to optimize their use.

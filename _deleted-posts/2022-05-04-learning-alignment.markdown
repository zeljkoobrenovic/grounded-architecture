When we have teams of architects, such groups can transform individual experiences into collective knowledge that can benefit the whole organization.

## Increasing Alignment

Our next goals was to create mechanisms to leverage and accelerate local decision-making while not taking autonomy and accountability for decisions from local units. In particular, we aim to develop global structures that can help people before and after they make an architectural decision:
* Before people decide, we want to stimulate people working simultaneously on the same topics to work together, minimize effort duplication, and in that way save time and resources.
* After making a decision, we want to make sure that we make other parts of the organization aware of it and that the distributes or lessons learned so that organization can profit from lessons learned in one unit. Get all the experiences and lessons learned from other parts of organization working with similar issues.

## Maximizing Learning
> *"Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment."* -- Fred Brooks

> *" I expect you to learn to be better each day. I challenge you to look at each working day as an opportunity to learn more, and by doing so, to grow as a person."* -- L. David Marquet

One of our primary daily tasks is learning. We need to discover new things about our domain, teams, new tools, and technologies. As individual architects, we need to use each day as an opportunity to learn something new. We need to maximize personal learnings, transforming individual lessons learned into shared guidelines.

One of the problems I frequently see in organizations, particularly complex and international ones, is that they may not have natural spaces for group knowledge sharing. Consequently, architects' superglue attributes may uniquely position them to work together to create spaces for sharing knowledge about architecture and technology. These spaces include but are not limited to regular update calls, knowledge sharing sessions, or conferences.

In addition to creating spaces, as a community, we can further increase our learnings' value by deriving generalized insights from cross-group cases.

We also need to expose our knowledge externally to promote what we are doing, and get valuable external feedback. We wanted dto pro-activelly look for opportunities to give talks, write blog posts, or organize meetups.

One of the problems that many organizations face is that due to their complexity and size, they have more challenges in introducing new technologies compared to their disruptors (Figure 3). We have less time to understand and utilize new technology developments while the number of new technologies is increasing due to, e.g., continuous and accelerating evolution of cloud and mobile products.

As architects, we need to be proactive in the identification of relevant new technology developments. Based on our understanding of these developments, we need to create pragmatic technology recommendations for concrete platforms and across the organization.

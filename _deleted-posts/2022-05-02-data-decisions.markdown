> *"If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine."* -— Jim Barksdale

There are great benefits of making our decision process as much as possible data-driven. I see it as one of the most critical tasks for any architect to maintain high-quality data on relevant technology developments, both internal and external, providing fuel for data-driven decision-making.

One of the problems we face is that we have lots of data on technology, but they are not well-connected, and manual data input and gathering are still frequent. For that reason, we need to work on developing automated tools that facilitate insights into technology and business.

In line with becoming more data-driven, we need to create shared frameworks to move from opinion-based decisions to data-driven economic risk modeling. Such frameworks should achieve the following:
* dismantle the buzzwords, present the problem in clear terms, understandable to a broader audience
* identify the real drivers behind buzzwords based on internal and external research
* bring internal data and external trends
* translate drivers into an economic risk model, and use the model to find the best spot for the given business context

While each organization will need it own approach, here are some tips I found useful in my approach to forming architecture teams or "people platform":
* Before making grandiose plans for reorganizations, make sure to connect with the people already doing some architectural work in an organization have, creating a community of practices or a virtual team. In this stage it is important to be inclusive, connect all key tech leaders, regarding of their actual position and title. In any form of organizations it will be crucial to be well-connected to these people, so this effort is never wasted. If creating a virtual team is a part of your architecture strategy, make sure to move away from creating a informal community of practice towards creating a team, with more accountability and responsibility. I found it useful to get a by in from key stakeholders, e.g. CTOs who should want to get their people work together with other architects.
* In early stages also connect with as many as possible non-architecture stakeholders. Again, in any form of organizations it will be crucial to be well-connected to these stakeholders, so this effort is never wasted.
* Align on the shared "superglue" vision and other operating principles with all stakeholders.
* Build and grow central team or change reporting lines carefully, and with close collaboration with engineering managers and CTOs. 
* Avoid hiring [digital hitman](https://architectelevator.com/transformation/dont-hire-hitman/). Grow internal candidate if possible. Architect require knowledge of technology, domain and organization. Finding such a person externally may be very difficult.
* Externalize. Reach out and connect. Participate in external events. Publish. Being strong externally can help you internally, especially in highly political settings.

> * IT architecture is tough, male dominated field. As such, it is more abuse-prone than other disciplines. 
> * While there are cultural differences in how people treat each other and provide negative feedback, regardless of the culture, some things will always be abuse. Especially if such
> * Defining and defending boundaries is the key to minimizing abuse in any plase. Positiong architecture as supetglue, makes it much more difficult to define clear boundaries.

There's a lot written about bullying, especially about:

* how common it is (the answer: it's all too common);
* what happens to targets (the career, psychological and health effects can be devastating);
* what management should do (adopt policies and actions).

## What is Abuse

### Examples of Abuse in IT Architecture

* Relentless criticism; put-downs; condescending remarks; hostile gestures and looks
* Unreasonable demands; not giving credit for work done
* Threats; false allegations; unwarranted reprimands
* Name-calling, shouting, swearing
* Malicious gossip, ostracism ("the silent treatment");

### Examples of Wrong Answers to Abuse (Self-Blame)

Bullying is not nearly as drastic as torture or genocide, but the tactics used to dampen outrage are similar. The same five methods are regularly used by bullies and their allies.

(1) Cover-up. The bully makes demeaning comments when there are no witnesses. Tasks are assigned that are inappropriate for the target - too onerous, or with no challenge - but in a way that others will not easily recognise. Rumours are subtly spread. Evidence of obnoxious behaviour is destroyed.

Another form of cover-up is when the bully and witnesses simply behave as if nothing had happened, and deny that a blatant action ever occurred.

(2) Devaluation. The bully sometimes attacks directly, claiming work is not up to standard and denigrating the target's contributions. Or the bully might dismiss or misrepresent the target's work in a meeting. The target's personality is questioned. Labels are applied: paranoid, lazy, unstable, complaining, devious.

(3) Reinterpretation. Bullying behaviours are said actually to be supportive, friendly, well-intentioned, justified and necessary. Everything is claimed to be legitimate.

Alternatively, the behaviours may be blamed on the victim, who is said to have provoked them.

(4) Official channels. Workers concerned about bullying may be advised to put in a formal complaint, use a grievance procedure or even go to court. Seldom do these processes lead to a satisfactory outcome. Sometimes they become a new form of harassment and humiliation.

(5) Intimidation and bribery. Workers are often intimidated by bullies, fearing an escalation of harassment should they do anything about it. They may also fear dismissal or legal action. They may be threatened, either overtly or subtly. Co-workers sometimes join in the bullying in order to curry favour with bosses: this is a form of bribery.



To increase outrage from bullying, you need to challenge the five methods. Here's the general approach.

(1) Expose the bullying.

(2) Validate the target, by demonstrating good performance, loyalty, honesty and other positive traits.

(3) Interpret the bullying as unfair, and explain why contrary explanations are wrong.

(4) Mobilise support. Avoid official channels or use them as tools in exposing the unfairness.

(5) Refuse to be intimidated or bribed, and expose intimidation and bribery.

### How to Set Boundaries to Right Way

## Ara you a bully?

Some workers who claim they've been bullied are actually being treated reasonably. Some of them are bullies themselves. Such workers often lack self-awareness. They see tiny flaws in others' behaviour but not the larger flaws in their own.

How can you tell whether you're part of the problem? You can ask someone who's neutral - but remember, if you react badly to criticism, others won't want to tell you the truth.

Here are some questions to ask yourself.

* Have I had confrontations with quite a few different people?
* Am I hiding any information? Do I resist an open discussion of the issues?
* Do I make derogatory comments about others, openly or while gossiping?
* Have I threatened anyone?


## When Should You Leave?

Before taking action against abuse and bullying, you need to be prepared. Some people are so embarrassed and humiliated by their treatment that they couldn't possibly expose what has happened or stand up to an increased level of attack. The approach described here simply says which tactics are likely to be effective if you're able and willing to resist. The choice is yours.

How can you decide whether you're prepared? Consider what resources you have:

* Psychological strength. Can you handle ongoing or increased bullying, and see through a lengthy struggle?
* Health. Can your body handle continued stress? Are you exercising and eating well?
* Money. Can you afford to lose your job? Can you afford legal expenses?
* Allies. Are there others at work who will take your side? Will the union back you?
* Personal networks. Do you have family and friends who will support you through the toughest times?

* Write a list of your resources. Then compare it to the other side's resources. Use this to help decide whether to resist. Sometimes it's better to lie low and wait until the time is right, or to let someone else take the lead. Sometimes even the best tactics will not succeed.

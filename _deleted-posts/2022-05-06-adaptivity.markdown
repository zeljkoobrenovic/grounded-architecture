*“It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change.”* — Charles Darwin


The three elements of the grounded Architecture model, data, people, and strategy/governance platforms, provide a highly flexible and adaptive setting. This adaptivity is driven by the independence of elements and the possibility to use the elements in a number of different combinations. Here are some of the key drivers of flexibility:

The data platform, if implemented with a high level of automation, allows for quick extensions and reconfigurations to provide data for any change of direction. It was easy to extend the platform with new data after acquisitions or merges. And the ability to group data at multiple levels supported both the whati-if scenario analysis (e.g., impact of different reorganization scenarios) and quick baseline for any change in the organization.

Having both the distributed virtual/matrix team and the central team enables lots of adaptivity during significant events and transformations. A distributed team provides a crucial connection and feedback on the daily reality of each part of the organization. And the central team can spend more time on focused ad-hoc activities.

Grounding the architecture with data and people connections, also makes the work of a Chief Architect much more flexible. As most of the architectural decisions can be delegated to well-aligned teams,  a Chief Architect, as the most experienced technologies, can spend more time on crucial strategic initiatives, such as defining cloud, data, or platform strategies, or supporting decisions on mergers and acquisitions.

Lastly, the structure of our architecture model enables a more sustainable architecture function. With an established data platform and well-connected architect, even without a strong central team, the architecture can still provide a valuable impact on the organization.

## Example: Changing Architecture During Significant Reorganizations

The Figure 1 illustrates the framework that we have used to change the architecure funtion during several big re-organiztions.

The framework has three phases: 

* "Man Overboard", immediatelly after a significant reorganization people can fill disoriented.
* "Turn That Ship Around", a focus period of consolidations and transfomrations
* "Full Speed Ahead", where the effects of transfomrations and consolidations is leveraged to increase the spped of value delivery and creation.

In the "Man Overboard" phase, we focused on grounding, both in data and people space, while putting on hold strategy and governance activities. The data platform ws crucial in this initial phase to provide transparency and clarity on the whole landscape. And we put extra effort to both keep and expand our architecture community. The key goal of these activites was to keep crucial architecture talent, and create clarityon the situation.

In the "Turn That Ship Around Phase", the focus shifted on strengthening the central architecture team and focusin it to support implementation of key strategies. The data plafrom was now also used to support diferent scenario analyses and to serve as a feedback mechanism on the impact of transfomrational activiteis.

In the "Full Speed Ahead" phase, the focus was in further strengthening anf fine tuning all the elements, and optimizing ways of working to maximize learning, and alignment.

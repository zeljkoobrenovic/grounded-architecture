excerpt: "We wanted to create a governance model that acknowledges the complexity and diversity of our organization. We aimed at promoting a technology governance model as a well-balanced hybrid of three different ways of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and leading by context."

Each organization will have different architectural needs and context. When forming architecture functions, I use as a starting point these [two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/):
 * *"Your architecture team’s job is to solve your biggest problems. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that."*
 * *"Your organization has to earn its way to an effective architecture function. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems."*

Having in mind the previous two points, each organization will need to find set of activities and operating model to enable architecture to work on most important problems.



## Connecting Strategy and Implementation Building Blocks

The biggest issues that many organization face is not a lack of business strategy nor the lack of developers and technology resources. Rather, the main problem is that these two elements are frequently note explicitelly connected.

Activities: Planned Initiatives Support	
Activities: Ad-Hoc Activites	
Activities: New Planning Cycle Support
Activities: Other AVIV Activities
Activities: WL Capabilities Map Definition	83 items
Activities: Important Regular Meetings	18 items
Activities: Legacy Projects Knowledge Support
Activities: Strategic Recommendations
Activities: Technical Due Diligences
Activities: Design Authority

## Less Control, More Innovation and Strategic Impact

Another element of flexibility of the grounded architecture originates from the possibility to spend more time working on big and important problems rather than with governance. As data platform provides a solid basis to understand the state across the organization, less time is needed to do clerical tasks related to data collection. And as people are encouraged to take initiatives, more governance happens in a distributed manner. The positionin gof architecure as superglue, also enables delegating part of governance to other parts of organization.

## Supporting Key Strategic Activities

In addition to governance activities, 

* Supporting merger and acquisitions (M&A) activities with expertize and analyses
* Defining vision and direction of technology, frequently in collaboration with CTOs
* Performing SWOT and other analyses of platforms and system
* Cloud Strategy, Data Strategy, Platform Strategy
* ...

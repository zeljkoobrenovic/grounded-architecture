excerpt: "The Operating Model in the Grounded Architecture framework provides a flexible, principle-driven structure for aligning architecture with business goals, but its effectiveness ultimately hinges on data and collaboration rather than process alone."

> **IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:** Get an overview of the Operating Model in the Grounded Architecture framework that provides a flexible, principle-driven structure for aligning architecture with business goals.
>
> **KEY POINTS:**
>
> * The Operating Model is a core part of the Grounded Architecture framework, guiding how architecture functions within an organization through principles, governance, and practices.
> * It is designed to evolve with the organization while ensuring architectural activities remain aligned with business objectives.
> * We introduce four main areas of the operating model: General Principles, Governance (Nudges, Taxation, Mandates), Transformation Support (in support of Grounded Architecture Goals), and Generative AI.
> * The model’s success depends on robust data (Lightweight Architectural Analytics) and strong collaboration (Collaborative Networks), not just processes and structure.

In this section, we will explore the **Operating Model**, a crucial element of the Grounded Architecture framework (see Figure 1). The Operating Model offers a **structured approach** to how an architecture practice operates within an organization. It outlines the **principles, governance structures, and operational practices** that guide architects in their daily tasks.

Designed to be **flexible and adaptive**, the Operating Model evolves alongside the organization while consistently focusing on **delivering value** through architecture. It ensures that architectural efforts align with business goals and are effectively coordinated across teams and domains.

The Operating Model comprises four main areas:

* **[General Principles](operating-model)**  
  A set of guiding values and actionable principles to help architects operate effectively. These principles highlight the importance of utilizing data and networks to create meaningful, measurable impact across the organization.

* **[Governance Principles: Nudges, Taxation, Mandates](governance)**  
  A balanced approach to IT governance, blending three styles:

  * **Nudging**: Subtle guidance through defaults and visibility
  * **Taxation**: Economic incentives to influence behavior
  * **Mandates**: Clear rules and standards to ensure compliance
  
  This flexible model allows organizations to strike a balance between **innovation and consistency** as well as **autonomy and alignment**.

* **[Transforming with Grounded Architecture](transforming)** (in support of Grounded Architecture [Goals](goals))
  An examination of how Grounded Architecture facilitates meaningful organizational transformation, which includes:

  * Executing at scale
  * Enhancing data-driven decision-making
  * Maximizing alignment and learning
  * Increasing adaptability

* **[Bonus: Leveraging Generative AI in Architecture](gen-ai)**  
  Practical methods for utilizing Generative AI as a tool for enhancement—automating routine tasks, improving collaboration, and accelerating analysis—while acknowledging the necessity of **responsible use, human oversight, and strong governance**.

While the Operating Model offers a wealth of structures and ideas, it is essential to emphasize one key point: **no operating model functions in isolation.**

Without **healthy Lightweight Architectural Analytics** (data) and **strong Collaborative Networks** (people), any operating model risks becoming an **ivory tower**—a set of well-meaning policies and opinions that are disconnected from the realities of daily work.

In summary: **people and data come first—process comes second.**

excerpt: "The Architecture Activities Platform is the place where, by leveraging data and people pillars, we performed activities that help an organization to reach it goals. Here are some examples: supporting teams in their daily work; tracking tech debt, defining tech debt reduction programs; performing technical due diligence; standardization of processes and documentation; defining cloud, data, and platform strategies."

Each organization will have different architectural needs and contexts. When forming architecture functions, I use as a starting point these [two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/):
 * *"Your architecture team’s job is to solve your biggest problems. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that."*
 * *"Your organization has to earn its way to an effective architecture function. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems."*

Considering the previous two points from Gregor Hohpe, each organization must find activities and operating models to enable architecture to work on the most critical problems. 

The Architecture Activities Platform is where we have to perform activities that help an organization reach its goals. In all of these activities, data and people pillars provide foundations for data-informed decision-making well-embedded in the organization.

Here are some examples of activities:
* Design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions 
* Supporting teams in their daily work
* Supporting planned new initiatives and projects
* Supporting teams in dealing with legacy landscape
* Tracking tech debt, defining tech debt reduction programs
* Performing technical due diligence
* Standardization of processes and documentation
* Supporting merger and acquisitions (M&A) activities with expertise and analyses
* Defining vision and direction of technology, frequently in collaboration with CTOs
* Performing SWOT and other analyses of platforms and system
* Defining Cloud, Data, and Platform strategies

<br>
While exact activities and their scope will depend on an organization setting and will change over time, in daily work, we aimed to implement the common operational model:

* Architects engage with stakeholders and product and project teams in a **collaborative and supportive manner**
* Architects aimed at **empowering the teams** so that they make and document most of the decisions.
* In all activities, the architecture function provided: 
  * **data** to inform decisions leveraging the [Data Pillar](data-pillar)
  * **decisions boundaries** to enable the minimal level of compatibility and strategic alignment (e.g., public cloud provider, tech stack constraints)
  * **principles** to facilitate consistency in decision-making
* Architects then spend their time in **constant motion** between supporting teams' **daily work** and working on **strategic topics**, helping the organization achieve alignment between strategy and implementation.

Inspired by Gregor Hohpe's strategy-principles-decisions model, the following picture illustrates the process:

## Performance & Growth Management

I have frequently used the Radical Candor framework (a management philosophy developed by Kim Scott) to manage the performance and growth of IT architects, focusing on fostering an environment of honest communication and personal development. Here's how we apply the fundamental principles that you could use as an inspiration for your processes.

<br>
### Key Principles

#### Care Personally
- **Build Relationships:** Prioritize building strong relationships with each IT architect, understanding their motivations, career aspirations, and personal goals. This foundation of trust makes it easier to give and receive feedback.
- **Support and Empathy:** Ensure each team member feels valued and supported, showing genuine care for their well-being and professional growth.

#### Challenge Directly
- **Honest Feedback:** Provide clear, specific feedback on their performance, ensuring it is both direct and constructive. This feedback helps IT architects understand their strengths and areas for improvement without ambiguity.
- **Timely Interventions:** Address performance issues promptly as they arise, preventing small problems from escalating and ensuring continuous improvement.

#### Give Praise and Criticism
- **Balanced Approach:** Maintain a balance between praising good performance and providing constructive criticism. This approach ensures that IT architects feel recognized for their achievements while being aware of areas needing development.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Deliver specific and actionable criticism, giving clear guidance on how to improve and succeed.

#### Create a Feedback Culture
- **Encourage Two-Way Feedback:** Foster an environment where IT architects feel comfortable giving feedback to us and their peers, promoting openness and trust within the team.
- **Regular Check-ins:** Conduct regular one-on-one meetings to discuss performance, goals, and feedback, ensuring continuous communication and alignment.

#### Focus on Growth
- **Development Plans:** Use feedback to create personalized development plans for each IT architect, aligning their growth with the organization's objectives and career aspirations.
- **Continuous Learning:** Encourage a culture of continuous learning, providing resources and opportunities for skill enhancement and professional growth.

#### Manage Performance Reviews
- **Transparent Criteria:** Ensure that performance reviews are based on transparent and fair criteria so IT architects understand how their performance is assessed.
- **Consistency:** Apply performance standards consistently across the team to maintain fairness and equity in evaluations.

The described framework aims to create a supportive environment that promotes growth, accountability, and high performance.

<br>
### Performance Management

Performance targets need to be closely aligned with the organization's strategic goals and should be articulated in terms of their impact (refer to the [impact section](impact) for more details). These targets should encompass the following aspects (Figure 2):

1. **Big-Picture Thinking**: Ensuring that every target supports the organization's overarching vision and long-term objectives. It involves understanding how individual contributions fit into the broader context and drive the organization forward.

2. **Execution**: Focusing on effectively implementing strategies and plans. Support efficient and timely achievement of tasks and projects.

3. **Leveling Up**: Encouraging continuous improvement and development, Enhancing skills, processes, and performance standards, and fostering a culture of growth and excellence within the organization.

***Figure 2:** An example framework for defining goals of architects: aligned with ogranizationals strategic goals, mesured in terms of three pillars of impact (big-picture thinking, execution, and leveling up).*

<br>
### Growth Management

Another idea I borrow from Radical Candor is the recognition that employees have different career trajectories and aspirations in growth and performance. It divides these into two main categories: the steep growth trajectory (superstars) and the stable growth trajectory (rock stars, solid as a rock). People of both growth trajectories could have poor or exceptional performance (Figure 3).

![](assets/images/performance-growth.png)
***Figure 3:** An example framework for measuring the performance of architects of different growth trajectories.*


Here's an overview of how views growth and performance for rock stars and superstar:

#### Stable Growth Trajectory (Rock Stars)

These employees excel in their current roles and derive satisfaction from achieving excellence in a stable, consistent manner.  They prefer deepening their expertise and maintaining a high level of performance without necessarily seeking rapid promotion.

**Growth Opportunities for Rock Stars:**
- **Enhanced Responsibilities:** Taking on critical projects, mentoring others, and providing technical oversight.
- **Expertise Development:** Becoming subject matter experts, gaining a "guru" status, and engaging in teaching and coaching.
- **Role Variability:** Shifting between roles (e.g., Senior, Principal, Enterprise Architect) to change the scope of work and maintain engagement.

**Performance Management of Rock Stars:**
- **Feedback:** Offer constructive feedback that helps them refine their expertise and maintain high performance.
- **Support:** Provide opportunities for continuous learning, such as advanced training or involvement in specialized projects.
- **Recognition:** Value their deep expertise and stability, acknowledging their critical role in the team's success.

#### Steep Growth Trajectory (Superstars)

These individuals are highly ambitious and driven, continuously seeking new challenges and responsibilities. They have a rapid professional development pace and are often on the path to leadership roles.

**Growth Opportunities for Superstars:**
- **Career Advancement:** Superstars often aim for significant promotions, such as moving from Architect to Senior Architect, Chief Architect, or even transitioning to roles like Director of Engineering or CTO.
- **Skill Development:** They focus on acquiring new skills, mastering advanced technologies, and improving leadership capabilities.
- **Increased Responsibilities:** Taking on more complex projects, leading teams, and contributing to strategic initiatives.

**Performance Management of Superstars:**
- **Feedback:** Provide challenging feedback that pushes them to grow while recognizing their achievements.
- **Support:** Offer opportunities for further education, mentorship, and exposure to high-stakes projects.
- **Recognition:** Acknowledge their contributions and potential for future leadership roles within the organization.


By applying these principles, we aimed to create an environment where employees feel supported and challenged, leading to higher engagement, better performance, and more effective personal and professional growth.

<br>
### Career Conversations

Whenever I can, I incorporate [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-have-career-conversations/) career conversations with architects. While you need to find a way for your team and organization, for me, it helped organize architects' careers. The Radical Candor framework proposes three career conversations: Life Story, Dreams, and Career Action Plan.

**Understanding Motivations and Values - Life Story**

The first step in the Radical Candor career conversations approach is understanding the motivations and values driving individuals. You can gain valuable insights by paying close attention to a person's life story and asking about their significant pivots and transitions. Why did they make those choices? What did those transitions teach them about their preferences in their work?

**Exploring Aspirations - Dreams**

The second step is to understand where people aim to be at the peak of their careers. While some managers might doubt that younger workers know what they want to be when they grow up, everyone has dreams. It's essential to help individuals make these dreams more tangible. Some managers might worry about asking employees to focus on a single vision too early in their careers.

However, these concerns should not prevent you from having Career Conversations. People and their dreams evolve, so regular Career Conversations are crucial. Just like seeking feedback from your team, these discussions are an ongoing practice.

**Creating an Action Plan - Career Action Plan**

With an understanding of both the past and future, you can now develop a relevant and thoughtful action plan with clear responsibilities and timelines.

While Career Conversations take time, I integrated them into my usual one-on-one meetings. These discussions often become some of the most enjoyable and productive interactions.

## Hiring Architects


Developing and hiring architects requires **constantly raising the bar** to ensure a strong and diverse team structure. Having more architects does not necessarily leads to a better team. Having good **alignment and diversity of perspectives** is even more important for an architecture team than for other groups.

<div class="quote">
It is vital to take more active ownership of hiring architects. Due to the vast diversity of how companies define the architect's role, recruiters may need help understanding the role's requirements.

It is vital to take more **active ownership of hiring architects**. Due to the vast diversity of how different companies define the architect's role, recruiters may need help understanding the role's requirements.

While you will need to design your hiring process, the hiring process should ensure a solid evaluation of the candidates:
  * **[Technical skills](skills)**: An architect must possess a solid technical background in the relevant areas, such as software development, infrastructure, cloud computing, and security. The process can assess their expertise through technical questions, tests, or case studies.
  * **[Communication and collaboration skills](skills)**: Architects often work with stakeholders, including business leaders, developers, and project managers. Therefore, the process could evaluate the candidate's ability to communicate effectively, work in a team, and manage stakeholders.
  * **[Leadership and problem-solving abilities](impact)**: As a senior team member, an architect should have strong leadership skills and the ability to solve complex problems. The process could assess the candidate's experience leading teams, making critical decisions, and resolving technical challenges.
  * **[Cultural fit](leadership)**: The process could also evaluate the candidate's fit with the company's culture, values, and mission. The cultural fit is vital to ensure the candidate shares the same vision and will likely thrive in the organization.

In terms of steps, I typically work with some version of the following process (after standard recruitment screening):

**Step 1: Initial Screening Interview with Chief Architect**

* Typical duration 60 min
* In this step, assessing the candidate's overall fit for the role is crucial, determining whether they possess the necessary skills, experience, and qualifications. 
* Overall, the initial screening aims to identify the most promising candidates who possess the necessary skills, experience, and fit for the role of a senior solutions architect and who should proceed to the next stage of the interview process.
* Extra focus on:
  * Cultural fit
  * Leadership and problem-solving abilities
    
**Step 2: In-Depth Interview with Senior/Principle/Enterprise Architects**

* Typical duration 90 min
* Extra focus on:
  * Evaluating the candidate's technical skills
  * Assessing the candidate's communication and collaboration skills
  * Understanding the candidate's leadership and problem-solving abilities

**Step 3: In-Depth Interview with Architects and Senior Engineers**

* Typical duration 90 min
* Preparation:
  * A document describing a recent solution architecture of a candidate, providing the content for discussion and helping estimate the candidate's written skills.
  * (Optional) open-source code review of a candidate
* Extra focus on:
  * Any topics identified during Step 2 as areas that needed to explore further.
  
For senior positions, I typically introduce an additional step of meeting senior leadership:

**Step 4: Non-technical stakeholders evaluation**

* Interview with Engineering Leaders
* Interview with Product and Business Function Leaders (e.g., CPO, CMO, CFO)
* Interview with a CTO
* Extra focus on:
   * Leadership abilities
   * Communication and collaboration skills

With the described steps, you can get a solid overview of all critical aspects of superglue architects. In particular, the involvement of people outside architecture or engineering is crucial to minimize risk related to a lack of interest and ability to engage with all relevant stakeholders.

Certainly—here’s the revised version of the **"Onboarding Architects"** section, now including the crucial role of the **Chief Architect**, especially for senior hires:

<br>
## Onboarding Architects: An Overlooked Yet Critical Step

While many organizations invest significant time and effort into hiring IT architects, **onboarding often remains an underdeveloped and vaguely defined process**. This oversight can undermine the entire hiring effort, as newly hired architects are left to figure out the organization’s culture, systems, and expectations largely on their own. In the context of **Grounded Architecture**, this represents a major gap between strategic intent and operational execution.

Too often, onboarding for architects consists of a few orientation meetings, access to documentation, and introductions to stakeholders—without clear guidance on how to operate within the company’s unique architectural ecosystem. As a result, architects may spend weeks—or even months—**working inefficiently, misaligned with key priorities**, and missing critical context. This can lead to frustration, lost momentum, and a delay in realizing their full impact.

### Designing a Strong Onboarding Experience

An effective onboarding process for architects should be deliberate, structured, and aligned with the company’s architectural vision and culture. Here are key elements that can make onboarding more successful:

#### 1. **Assign a Buddy Architect**

Pairing the new hire with an experienced architect who can provide guidance, context, and historical background helps reduce the learning curve. This “buddy” acts as a translator of both technical practices and organizational dynamics.

Here’s the updated **"Create an Architecture Playbook"** section with the added point about direct access to relevant data, including a reference to *Lightweight Architecture Analytics* from the Grounded Architecture initiative:

#### 2. **Create an Architecture Playbook**

Provide a concise document or portal that outlines:

* Architectural principles and decision-making processes
* Current state and strategic roadmap
* Key systems and integrations
* Team roles and responsibilities
* **Direct access to relevant data** – such as dashboards, metrics, and architecture signals. For example, tools like [*Lightweight Architecture Analytics*](https://grounded-architecture.io/analytics) can offer valuable insights into architectural trends, code dependencies, and decision-making patterns across the organization.

This playbook reduces ambiguity, accelerates alignment, and ensures that new architects can operate based on evidence rather than assumptions.

This reduces ambiguity and accelerates alignment.

#### 3. **Early Immersion in Real Work**

Engage new architects in meaningful work within their first two weeks. Shadowing active projects, participating in architecture reviews, or analyzing an existing solution can provide critical real-world exposure and surface hidden assumptions.

#### 4. **Set 30-60-90 Day Goals**

Help the architect build momentum by defining clear, time-bound objectives:

* **First 30 days**: Understand organizational goals, culture, and architecture frameworks
* **60 days**: Contribute to small improvements or analyses
* **90 days**: Lead a design review or produce a proposal with meaningful stakeholder input

#### 5. **Include Cross-Functional Introductions**

Because architects operate across domains, introduce them to engineering, product, infrastructure, security, and business leaders early on. Establishing these relationships is key to long-term influence and effectiveness.

#### 6. **Ensure Active Chief Architect Involvement for Senior Roles**

For senior architect positions, **daily involvement from the Chief Architect is critical during the initial onboarding phase**. These roles often require deep engagement in strategy, alignment with high-level initiatives, and an understanding of organizational nuance. A Chief Architect can:

* Provide direct mentoring and feedback
* Accelerate integration into decision-making forums
* Clarify priorities and unspoken norms
* Help prevent missteps that could impact architecture at scale

This kind of **high-touch onboarding is essential for setting senior architects up for success** and ensuring they can begin to contribute strategically from day one.

#### 7. **Encourage Career Conversations Early**

Following the principles of Radical Candor, initiate career conversations even during onboarding. Understanding the architect’s motivations and aspirations helps tailor the onboarding experience and sets the tone for a long-term growth journey.

<br>

**By formalizing onboarding with the same care and rigor used in hiring**, and ensuring strong support from senior leadership, companies can empower architects to contribute effectively, build trust quickly, and align their work with strategic outcomes. In doing so, organizations uphold the spirit of Grounded Architecture—making decisions based on deep context, collaborative alignment, and purposeful intent.

## Typical Architect's Career Paths

My view of architecture has a strong engineering bias. Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background. While there may be exceptions, without significant real-world exposure to software engineering challenges, an architect cannot obtain enough practical knowledge to make technology decisions and build relations with developer teams. 

Regarding career progression, Figure 1 shows an example of architecture career paths in relation to engineering, which I used to define architecture career paths.

***Figure 1:** An example of architecture career paths in relation to engineering.*

Stepping from an engineering position to an architecture requires three changes:
* Getting a broader scope of work,
* Having a higher diversity of work, and 
* Changing skills, as communication and influencer skills become crucial aspects of success.

All architect are responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within some critical area. They need to combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.

After the role of an Architect, I usually envision three tracks of progression:
* **Senior Architect**, a generalist with broader responsibilities to, who digs deep into complex issues and identifies a suitable course of action. They often navigate from one critical area to another, guided by the organization's direction.
* **Principal Architect**, a senior architect with a special focus on some area of strategic interest for an organization (e.g., data, distributed systems, frontend).
* **Enterprise Architect**, being closer to product, management, strategy, and business functions, frequently serving as senior engineering leaders' right hand. 

But an architect's path can take many different directions and have many other names. More important than a formal title is a continuous search for staying relevant and making an impact as a [superglue](superglue).

## Hiring Architects


<!-- ![](assets/images/aRCH/Female-Pole-Vault.jpg) -->

Developing and hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure. Having more architects does not necessarily leads to a better team. Having good alignment and diversity of perspective is even more important for an architecture team than for other groups.

In my experiences, it is vital to take more active ownership of hiring architects. Due to the vast diversity of how different companies define the architect's role, recruiters may need help understanding the role's requirements.

The superglue aspects of architects also require a hiring process that can identify candidates that can operate well according to such a vision. While you will need to design your hiring process, I typically have worked with some version of the following process (after standard recruitment screening):

* **Step 1: Initial Screening Interview with Chief Architect:**
* **Step 2: In-Depth Interview with Senior/Principle/Enterprise Architects:**
* **Step 3: In-Depth (System Design) Interview with Architects and Senior Engineers:**
    * Preparation:
        * A document describing a recent solution architecture of a candidate, providing the content for discussion and helping estimate the candidate's written skills.
        * (Optional) open-source code review of a candidate
For senior positions, I typically introduce an additional step of meeting senior leadership:
* **Step 4:**
    * Interview with Engineering Leaders
    * Interview with Product and Business Function Leaders (e.g., CPO, CMO, CFO)
    * Interview with a CTO

With the described steps, you can get a solid overview of all critical aspects of superglue architects. In particular, the involvement of people outside architecture or engineering is crucial to minimize risk related to a lack of interest and ability to engage with all relevant stakeholders.

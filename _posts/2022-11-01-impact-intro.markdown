When Grounded Architecture is in place, it can have a significant positive impact on the functioning of an organization:

* Increasing the Quality of Decision-Making with Data,
* Executing At Scale,
* Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning, and
* High Adaptivity.

The following sections elaborate on these impact categories.

## Increasing Decision Quality with Data

> *"If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine."* -— Jim Barksdale

There are great benefits of making our decision process as much as possible data-driven. I see it as one of the most critical tasks for any architect to maintain high-quality data on relevant technology developments, both internal and external, providing fuel for data-driven decision-making.

One of the problems we face is that we have lots of data on technology, but they are not well-connected, and manual data input and gathering are still frequent. For that reason, we need to work on developing automated tools that facilitate insights into technology and business.

In line with becoming more data-driven, we need to create shared frameworks to move from opinion-based decisions to data-driven economic risk modeling. Such frameworks should achieve the following:
* dismantle the buzzwords, present the problem in clear terms, understandable to a broader audience
* identify the real drivers behind buzzwords based on internal and external research
* bring internal data and external trends
* translate drivers into an economic risk model, and use the model to find the best spot for the given business context

## Executing at Scale

One of the main impacts of our hybrid architecture model was ability to efficiently operate at scale. Our architecture data platform supported operating a scale through automation and self-service tools. Our virtual architectural team enabled us to develop connected at all levels of the organization increasing visibility and speeding up execution of shared decisions. 

Several characteristics of our model that contributed to possibility of advocating a scale. One characteristic is having presence at multiple levels. The same characteristics is having tools that enable presentation of data at different level of obstruction and aggregation. In this way we were able to keep a helicopter view about our landscape while the same time being able to quickly zooming into details depending on the issue of your address. Zooming in and outs is one of the key characteristics of our way of working. 

### Tool Design: Zooming In, Zooming Out

We also propagated the philosophy of zooming in and out at all of our tools. On the one hand our tools enable providing complete abstracted view of the whole landscape summarizing data from all teams and groups. The same time we were able to zoom in to the details of particular systems even to the cold level. That means that we were you able to use the same tools to have sea level discussions looking at overall trends in our technology usage and costs. At the same time were able to engage with developers and really discuss concrete code fragments and potential improvements in the code level (e.g., duplicated blocks, complex units, dependencies).

### Hybrid Team Structure Supports Scalability

Our hybrid team structure all supported etiquette Nick scale. The virtual architecture team supported execution both by increasing number of people involved in architectural activities and increasing efficiency of our work by better alignment. By having members official technical team representing diverse organizational units we were able to have much more impact across the board. And having some capacity on central level serve as a catalyst helping people local levels to do their job while being aligned and better connected with overall strategic goals and other teams working with similar topics.

## Maximizing Alignment & Learning

When we have teams of architects, such groups can transform individual experiences into collective knowledge that can benefit the whole organization.

### Alignment

Our next goals was to create mechanisms to leverage and accelerate local decision-making while not taking autonomy and accountability for decisions from local units. In particular, we aim to develop global structures that can help people before and after they make an architectural decision:
* Before people decide, we want to stimulate people working simultaneously on the same topics to work together, minimize effort duplication, and in that way save time and resources.
* After making a decision, we want to make sure that we make other parts of the organization aware of it and that the distributes or lessons learned so that organization can profit from lessons learned in one unit. Get all the experiences and lessons learned from other parts of organization working with similar issues.

### Learning
> *"Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment."* -- Fred Brooks

> *" I expect you to learn to be better each day. I challenge you to look at each working day as an opportunity to learn more, and by doing so, to grow as a person."* -- L. David Marquet

One of our primary daily tasks is learning. We need to discover new things about our domain, teams, new tools, and technologies. As individual architects, we need to use each day as an opportunity to learn something new. We need to maximize personal learnings, transforming individual lessons learned into shared guidelines.

One of the problems I frequently see in organizations, particularly complex and international ones, is that they may not have natural spaces for group knowledge sharing. Consequently, architects' superglue attributes may uniquely position them to work together to create spaces for sharing knowledge about architecture and technology. These spaces include but are not limited to regular update calls, knowledge sharing sessions, or conferences.

In addition to creating spaces, as a community, we can further increase our learnings' value by deriving generalized insights from cross-group cases.

We also need to expose our knowledge externally to promote what we are doing, and get valuable external feedback. We wanted dto pro-activelly look for opportunities to give talks, write blog posts, or organize meetups.

One of the problems that many organizations face is that due to their complexity and size, they have more challenges in introducing new technologies compared to their disruptors (Figure 3). We have less time to understand and utilize new technology developments while the number of new technologies is increasing due to, e.g., continuous and accelerating evolution of cloud and mobile products.

As architects, we need to be proactive in the identification of relevant new technology developments. Based on our understanding of these developments, we need to create pragmatic technology recommendations for concrete platforms and across the organization.

## Adaptivity 

The three elements of the grounded Architecture model, data, people, and strategy/governance platforms, provide a highly flexible and adaptive setting. This adaptivity is driven by the independence of elements and the possibility to use the elements in a number of different combinations. Here are some of the key drivers of flexibility:

The data platform, if implemented with a high level of automation, allows for quick extensions and reconfigurations to provide data for any change of direction. It was easy to extend the platform with new data after acquisitions or merges. And the ability to group data at multiple levels supported both the whati-if scenario analysis (e.g., impact of different reorganization scenarios) and quick baseline for any change in the organization.

Having both the distributed virtual/matrix team and the central team enables lots of adaptivity during significant events and transformations. A distributed team provides a crucial connection and feedback on the daily reality of each part of the organization. And the central team can spend more time on focused ad-hoc activities.

Grounding the architecture with data and people connections, also makes the work of a Chief Architect much more flexible. As most of the architectural decisions can be delegated to well-aligned teams,  a Chief Architect, as the most experienced technologies, can spend more time on crucial strategic initiatives, such as defining cloud, data, or platform strategies, or supporting decisions on mergers and acquisitions.

Lastly, the structure of our architecture model enables a more sustainable architecture function. With an established data platform and well-connected architect, even without a strong central team, the architecture can still provide a valuable impact on the organization.

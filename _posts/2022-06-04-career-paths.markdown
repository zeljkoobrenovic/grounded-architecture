Developing and hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure. Having more architects does not necessarily leads to a better team. Having good alignment and diversity of perspective is even more important for an architecture team than for other groups.

## Typical Superglue Architect's Career Paths

My view of architecture has a strong engineering bias. Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background. While they may be exceptions, without significant real-world exposure to software engineering challenges, an architect cannot obtain enough practical knowledge to make technology decisions and build relations with developer teams. I also use Staff Engineering roles as an inspiration for the development of architects. For instance, Will Larson's book [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/) is a helpful guide in defining the responsibilities of modern architects.

In terms of career progression, Figure 1 shows an example of architecture career paths in relation to engineering.

***Figure 1:** An example of architecture career paths in relation to engineering.*

Stepping from an engineering position to an architecture requires three changes:
* Getting a broader scope of work,
* Having a higher diversity of work, and 
* Changing skills, as communication and influencer skills become crucial aspects of success.

After becoming Architects, I usually envision three tracks of progression:
* **Senior Architect**, a generalist with a broader set of responsibilities,
* **Principal Architect**, a world-class expert in some area of strategic interest for an organization (e.g., data, distributed systems, frontend).
* **Enterprise Architect**, being closer to product, management, strategy, and business functions, frequently serves as senior engineering leaders' right hand.

## Hiring Superglue Architects

It is vital to take more active ownership of hiring architects. Due to the vast diversity of how different companies define the architect's role, recruiters may need help understanding the role's requirements.

The superglue aspects of architects also require a hiring process that can identify enough potential candidates to operate well according to such a vision. While you will need to design your hiring process, I typically have worked with some version of the following process:

* **Step 1: Initial Screening Interview with Chief Architect:**
    * I typically look for culture adds, not a mere culture fit, to ensure the sharpness and diversification of the group. 
    * General interests, ways of working and background discussion
    * Behavioral traits
* **Step 2: In-Depth Interview with Senior (Enterprise) Architects, including topics:**
    * Customer focus
    * Legacy
    * Frugality
    * Bias for action
    * Ownership
    * Innovation
* **Step 3: In-Depth Interview with Architects:**
    * Preparation:
        * A document describing a recent solution architecture of a candidate, providing the content for discussion and helping estimate the candidate's written skills.
        * (Optional) open-source code review of a candidate
    * Cloud design patterns
    * Domain-Driven Design
    * Security
    * Privacy
    * Performance efficiency
    * Reliability
    * A range of other technical topics depending on the position  
 
 For senior positions, I typically introduce an additional step of meeting additional senior leadership:
 * **Step 4:**
    * Interview with Engineering Leaders (Senior Solution Architects, Enterprise Architects, Principal Architect)
    * Interview with Product and Business Function Leaders (e.g., CPO, CMO, CFO)
    * Interview with CTO (Enterprise Architect or Principal Architect)

With the described steps, you can get a solid overview of all critical aspects of superglue architects. In particular, the involvement of people outside architecture or engineering is crucial to minimize risk related to a lack of interest and ability to engage with all relevant stakeholders.

Grounded Architecture emerged as a necessity in response to our [intricate and multifaceted challenges](context). The Grounded Architecture framework was designed to address these specific challenges. By moving away from manual processes and embracing automation, data-driven decision-making, and adaptive frameworks, we aimed to create a **more resilient and effective** architectural practice. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the goals I set for an architecture practice.


## Goal 1: Executing At Scale

Our organizations were like a bustling city with hundreds of teams and thousands of projects, each with its own unique complexity and requirements. Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches to architecture practice simply couldn’t keep up with this dynamic environment. We needed a system that could support this vast and varied ecosystem. Grounded Architecture was designed to **handle such diversity at scale,** ensuring that teams and projects received the tailored support they needed without being bogged down by rigid processes.

Some of the key success criteria for this goal include:

* Full transparency about the technology landscape regardless of its size. Without full transparency, it isn't easy to understand the landscape's complexity or your work's context. This transparency should include good data and visualization of the size and quality of all source code repositories, public cloud accounts and technologies, private data centers, development efforts, etc.
* It is essential to have mechanisms and spaces to create and maintain practical working relationships with all development teams and key stakeholders. Knowing the organizational landscape and having practical spaces for engagement is crucial.
* Scaling and growing the organization without significantly slowing decision-making is critical. Finding the right balance between teams' autonomy and alignment is essential.


## Goal 2: Adaptivity

In our dynamic environments, significant change is not just frequent; it's expected. Whether these changes are organic, like evolving business needs, or inorganic, like mergers and acquisitions, our architecture must be **able to adapt swiftly**. Grounded Architecture was crafted to be flexible and responsive, allowing us to pivot quickly in response to new challenges and opportunities. This adaptability ensures that our architectural framework remains relevant and effective, no matter how the organizational landscape shifts.

Some of the key success criteria for this goal include:
* Tracking and supporting legacy and new technologies, adapting this support as the organization transforms and grows.
* Having ready data for analyses of different business scenarios (e.g., investment in legacy, buy-or-build, divestments...).
* Being able to quickly onboard and analyze the technology landscape of acquired companies.


## Goal 3: Increasing Quality of Decisions with Data

Relying on gut feelings or individual opinions is always insufficient and risky when dealing with operations at scale. Decisions need to be based on solid data to **ensure accuracy and reliability.** Grounded Architecture aims to incorporate advanced tools and mechanisms to support data-driven decision-making. By leveraging data and analytics, we can move away from subjective opinions and towards objective, evidence-based decisions. This approach enhances the quality of our decisions and ensures that they are consistent and aligned with our organizational goals.

Key success criteria for this goal include:
* Always having complete, up-to-date data about all key elements of the organizational technology landscape.
* Connect technical with product and business data (e.g., vibrancy vs. public cloud costs).
* Making data available via self-service tools for the organization to help them make more informed decisions.
* Routinely using these data in decision-making.


## Goal 4: Maximizing Organizational Alignment

In a global, fast-moving organization, misalignment can quickly become the norm. Different teams and departments might pursue conflicting objectives, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. Grounded Architecture aims to **serve as a cohesive force,** promoting alignment across the entire organization. Providing a clear, unified framework helps to minimize misalignments. It facilitates all parts of the organization working towards common goals. This alignment is crucial for maintaining efficiency and avoiding the chaos that can arise from disparate efforts.

Key success criteria for this goal include:
* Establish standardized guidelines and best practices (golden paths) for technology use, ensuring consistency across the organization. 
* Foster a culture of collaboration and shared understanding among teams to align on technology choices and implementation strategies. 
* Regularly review and update technology standards to align with evolving business needs and industry trends.
* Identify and eliminate redundant processes and activities to streamline operations and reduce wasted resources. 


## Goal 5: Maximizing Organizational Learning

Staying current with emerging technologies and industry trends is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. Still, it can be challenging when dealing with the demands of legacy systems. Grounded Architecture is designed to facilitate continuous learning and growth. It supports the rapid adoption of new technologies and encourages **ongoing education and training.** By keeping the organization up-to-date with the latest developments, Grounded Architecture aims to ensure we always have the best tools and knowledge to drive innovation and improvement.

Grounded Architecture aims to transform a typically cumbersome, manual-process-driven practice into a streamlined, adaptive, and learning-focused powerhouse. 

Key success criteria for this goal include:

* Organize frequent workshops, seminars, and training sessions to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices across the organization.
* Encourage employees at all levels to contribute to and participate in knowledge-sharing initiatives, promoting a culture of continuous learning.
* Develop platforms and tools that enable easy access to shared knowledge and resources, enhancing collective expertise.
* Involve a diverse range of stakeholders, including developers, managers, and end-users, in discussions and decision-making processes related to architecture and technology.
* Create opportunities for employees from various departments to engage in architectural planning and feedback sessions, ensuring a holistic approach to problem-solving.
* Establish cross-functional teams that include members from different roles and backgrounds, fostering collaboration and diverse perspectives in project development.

These criteria aim to create an inclusive and dynamic environment where knowledge is freely shared and diverse contributions are valued, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.

## Questions to Consider

Knowing what goals architecture practice needs to support in your organization is crucial to defining structures and measuring your impact. Some of the plans may be universally applicable. Others may be unique to your context. Ask yourself the following questions:

* *What is the scale of your architecture function? Does your scale require special measures to ensure your architecture practice efficient operations?*
* *What are the key decisions you need to make? Do you have the data to base your decisions?*
* *How aligned are units in your organizations? How much friction is there? How can architecture function help?*
* *How much is your organization learning? How is the learning supported?*
* *How stable is your organization? How likely is it that significant changes will occur in your organization?*

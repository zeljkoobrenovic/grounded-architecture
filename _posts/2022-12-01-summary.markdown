In this playbook, I explained an approach to running an running an architecture practice in larger organizations. I called this approach "grounded architecture," highlighting the need for any architecture function to stay well-connected to all levels of an organization and led by data. 

Grounded Architecture has two main parts:
* **Structure**, defining elements you need to have to run Grounded Architecture practice, and
* **Guiding Principles**, that can help put the ideas of Grounded Architecture into practice and build the right culture

The following figure illustrates the structure of the Grounded Architecture consisting of three elements:
* The Data Pillar,
* The People Pillar,
* The Architecture Activities Platform.

The *Data Pillar* ensures that architects can make data-informed decisions based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape.

The *People Pillar* is another essential element of Grounded Architecture. A strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact.

Lastly, the *Architecture Activities Platform* leverages data and people to create a data-informed, deep, and broad impact.

I have identified the following [guiding principles](principles) that can help put the ideas of Grounded Architecture into practice and get things done:
* [Architects as Superglue](superglue),
* [In the Eye of the Storm](storm),
* [Flexible Governance](flexible-governance),
* [Economic Modeling](economics),
* [Curisity, Doubt, Vision, Scepticism: Architect's Personal Compass](compass), and
* [Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](culture).

When Grounded Architecture is in place, it can have a significant [positive impact](impact) on the functioning of an organization:

* Enable Execution of Architecture Function At Scale,
* Increase the Quality of Decision-Making with Data,
* Maximize Organizational Alignment,
* Maximize Organizational Learning, and
* Increase Architecture Function Adaptivity.

Remember that while you may borrow ideas from others, every organization is different in the end, and your approach must adapt to your context. When forming architecture functions, I always advise not to forget these [two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/):
 * "*Your architecture team’s job is to solve your biggest problems. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that.*"
 * "*Your organization has to earn its way to an effective architecture function. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems.*"

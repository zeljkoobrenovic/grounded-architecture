excerpt: "We wanted to create a governance model that acknowledges the complexity and diversity of our organization. We aimed at promoting a technology governance model as a well-balanced hybrid of three different ways of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and leading by context."

In the following sections, we will describe three styles of governance and the role of Data and People platforms in them. In the end, I will also describe some other activities in which the architecture functions I was guiding were involved, again emphasizing the role of Data and People platforms in them.

In general, I would sumarize my appraoch with three principles: 
* Use Data and People pillars to facilitate data-informed decision-making with broader involvements
* Be flexible in governance, 
* Keep enough quality time to work on the most important strategic initiatives



## Quality Time for Strategic Activities

In addition to governnance activities, 

* Supporting merger and acquisitions (M&A) activities with expertize and analyses
* Defining vision and direction of technology, frequently in collaboration with CTOs
* Performing SWOT and other analyses of platforms and system
* Cloud Strategy, Data Strategy, Platform Strategy
* ...

When forming architecture functions, I use as a starting point these [two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/):
 * "Your architecture team’s job is to solve your biggest problems. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that."
 * "Your organization has to earn its way to an effective architecture function. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems."

<br>
Each organization will have different architectural needs and context.  


## Connecting Strategy and Implementation Building Blocks

* Be part of defining the strategy, rather than on the execution.
* Position architecture more towards innovation rather then control.
* Avoid a pure project-management role.

## Less Control, More Innovation and Strategic Impact

Another element of flexibility of the grounded architecture originates from the possibility to spend more time working on big and important problems rather than with governance. As data platform provides a solid basis to understand the state across the organization, less time is needed to do clerical tasks related to data collection. And as people are encouraged to take initiatives, more governance happens in a distributed manner. The positionin gof architecure as superglue, also enables delegating part of governance to other parts of organization.

TOGAF

Not against, but insists on grounding in data and people and with engineering bias and pragmatism. Against the ivory tower, but many of the conventional modeling and other tools are useful.

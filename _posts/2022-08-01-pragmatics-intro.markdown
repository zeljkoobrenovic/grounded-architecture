Having principles is useful, but you may also benefit from a few practical tips based on the lessons learned in my implementation of Grounded Architectures. I group these tips in three groups in line with the Ground Architecture model:
* [Data Pillar Lessons](lessons-data-pillar),
* [People Pillar Lessons](lessons-people-pillar), and
* [Strategy and Governance Platform Lessons](lessons-strategy-governance).

<b>The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role</b> by Gregor Hohpe defines architects as people that can fill an important void in large enterprises: they work and communicate closely with technical staff on projects, but are also able to convey technical topics to upper management without losing the essence of the message. Conversely, they understand the company’s business strategy and can translate it into technical decisions that support it.

 <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html">Scaling the Practice of Architecture, Conversationally</a> describes a way to do architecture as a series of conversations, driven by a decentralised and empowering decision-making technique, and supported by four learning and alignment mechanisms: Decision Records, Advisory Forum, Team-Sourced Principles, and a Technology Radar.

<b>Team Topologies</b> by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton describes four foundamental topologies (stream-aligned teams, enabling teams, complicated subsystem teams, and platform teams), and three fundamental interacition modes (collaboration, X-as-a-Service, and facilitation).

<b>Nudge</b> by Richard Thaler draws on research in psychology and behavioral economics to define libertarian paternalism as an active engineering of choice architecture. The book also popularised the concept of a nudge, a choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without restricting options or significantly changing their economic incentives.

<td>
<b>No Rules Rules</b> by Erin Meyer and Reed Hastings provides insights in Netflix culture. Relevanmt for our appraoch, we used the idea that when you give low-level employees access to information that is generally reserved for high-level executives, they get more done on their own. They work faster without stopping to ask for information and approval. They make better decisions without needing input from the top.

## Common Ground

This section is heavily influnced by Gregor Hohpe's article [The Architect’s Path (Part 2 - Bookshelf)](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/)

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/clean-code.jpeg" class="book">

<td>
<b>Clean Code</b> by “Uncle” Bob Martin. Good software starts with good code, and good code is clean. Here we start with the basics of naming, functions that do one thing well, and formatting.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/refactoring.jpeg" class="book">
</td>
<td>
<b>Refactoring</b> by Martin Fowler. Good software doesn’t just happen - it evolves, gains entropy, and is then restructured. The book’s subtitle reveals that this is a book about design.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/design-patterns.webp" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Design Patterns</b> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides. Going ever so slightly more abstract, design patterns help us make balanced decisions on the design of our code. This title must be close to 1/2 million copies sold by now.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/building-microservices.webp" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Building Microservices</b> (2nd Edition) by Sam Newman is really a book about architectural trade-offs and considerations in distributed system design rather than a pitch for one specific solution. That’s why it’s a great book for architects. It’s also very accessible.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/fundamentals-of-software-architecture.jpeg" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Fundamentals of Software Architecture</b> by Neal and Mark, although also covering soft skills, dedicates the majority of the book to modularity, component-based thinking, and architectural styles. Just what an architect needs to wire things together in the right way.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/eip.webp" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Enterprise Integration Patterns</b> is still relevant 17 years after publication (OK, minus the funny MSMQ examples and Java 1.4) for anyone trying to connect systems without coupling them too tightly. Several modern examples are available on-line.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/pattern-oriented-software-architecture.jpeg" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture</b>—inching towards conceptual, this tome from the same “POSA” series is a tougher read, but is one of the most comprehensive references for distributed system design.

<b>Just Enough Software Architecture</b> by George Fairbanks is a very approachable, yet quite comprehensive title that’ll make a good addition to any architect’s bookshelf.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/ssa.jpeg" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Software Systems Architecture</b> by Nick and Eóin covers a similar scope to George with a slightly stronger emphasis on viewpoints and perspectives. Written by hands-on architects, it shares pearls of wisdom on most every page. The only suggestion for improvement would be to condense the content down a tiny bit—almost 700 pages require a lot of discipline and patience.

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/tsp.jpeg" class="book">

<b>Technology Strategy Patterns</b> by Eben Hewitt is a nice catalog of all the stuff that appears in consultants’ fancy slide decks that you as an architect afterwards have to deal with. So, it behooves you to understand what’s going on there.

<b>The Phoenix Project</b> and it’s buddy The Unicorn Project</b> by Gene Kim and his tribe are standard reading to better understand the interface between business and IT and what can all go wrong there.

<b>Continuous Delivery</b>—software comes into being because it is being delivered. If you are concerned with rate of change, this is something you’d want to be doing continuously. This book just celebrated its 10th anniversary and is as relevant as ever.

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/accelerate.jpeg" class="book">

<td>

<b>Accelerate</b>—acceleration is the second derivative of position (speed being the first), so if you want to move faster you need to accelerate. Sometimes, you need to jerk the system a bit, which in fact the proper term for the third derivative.

<tr>
<td>
<img src="assets/images/books/evolutionary-achitectures.jpeg" class="book">

<b>Building Evolutionary Architectures</b> describes how to use fitness functions to guide architectural change over time. I thought the authors could have gotten a bit more our of this topic - perhaps we’ll see a second edition.

<b>Software Architecture for Developers</b> by Simon Brown is a practical, pragmatic and lightweight guide to software architecture, specifically aimed at software developers.

<img src="assets/images/books/hard-parts.jpg" class="book">
</td>
<td>

<b>Software Architecture: The Hard Parts</b> is structured as a narrative about a team breaking down a faulty outdated monolithic application into a modern microservices-based architecture. The authors compare different aspects of how a monolithic architecture might have been written to do something in the past, then how a modern microservice architecture could do the same thing today, offering advice and approaches for effective tradeoff analysis when refactoring a large monolith app.

<b>Domain-Driven Design</b> by Eric Evans promotes the idea that that to develop software for a complex domain, we need to build Ubiquitous Language that embeds domain terminology into the software systems that we build. DDD stresses defining models in software, and evolving them during the life of the software product.

<b>Release It!</b> (2nd Edition) by Mike Nygard’s is about architecture design and decisions regarding stability and how to build "cynical" software. Besides the well known stability patterns like circuit breakers and bulkheads the book introduces foundational knowledge about running systems in production, from processes to network to security, also covering more process oriented questions like deployments or handling security.

<b>Designing Data Intensive Systems</b> by Martin Kleppmann is a mini-encyclopedia of modern data engineering. Not a practice or a cookbook for a particular Big Data, NoSQL or newSQL product, the book lays down the principles of current distributed big data systems. Covers replication, partitioning, linearizability, locking, write skew, phantoms, transactions, event logs, and much more.

> **IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:**  Get a summary of the inspirations about doing architecture.

In the following sections, I introduce several resources that I use as inspiration for developing the decision-making skills of IT architects. I focus on topics not typically covered in IT architecture literature, drawing inspiration from social, behavioral, and management sciences:

* **[Decision Intelligence in IT Architecture](decision-intelligence)**: Decision intelligence is the discipline of turning information into better actions. The future of IT architecture will be closely related to decision intelligence.
* **[The Human Side of Decision-Making](human-decisions)** Decision-making is a human activity subject to human biases and limitations. Fundamental biases influencing decision-making include outcome, hindsight, and confirmation biases.
* **[Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options](economics)**: I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of technology investments and architecture: the return on investment metaphor and the financial options metaphor.
* **[Effortless Architecture](effortless)**: A summary of lessons learned from the Greg McKeown' Effortless book emphasis on simplifying tasks and processes is crucial in the tech industry, where complexity often dominates.

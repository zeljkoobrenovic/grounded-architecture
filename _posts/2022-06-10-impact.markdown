Architects' work is evaluated based on **their impact on the organization** (Figure 1). 

![](assets/images/arch/architects_impact.png)
***Figure 1:** Impact is one of the three main elements of being an architect (skills, impact, leadership). Leadership without impact lacks foundation and may signal that you have become an ivory tower architect with a weak relation to reality.*



Architects' contributions are typically assessed through the following key areas:

* **Identifying, Tackling, and Delivering on Strategic Problems**: Architects are responsible for recognizing and addressing strategic issues at both the organizational and area-specific levels (such as domains or technical areas). They can facilitate aligning work with the organization's broader strategic objectives, ensuring that efforts are prioritized to support global goals. By tackling these strategic problems, architects contribute to the organization's overall direction and success, providing solutions that align with long-term visions and targets.

* **Having a Deep and Broad Influence**: Architects must have a profound and extensive impact on their specific domain, product, or technology area. This influence requires them to delve deeply into particular critical issues, providing targeted solutions that address pressing challenges. Simultaneously, they need to maintain a broad perspective, creating value by leveraging their solutions across multiple teams and projects. This dual focus ensures that their influence is both concrete and widespread, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization.

* **Delivering Solutions that Few Others Can**: Architects are often tasked with providing solutions that are beyond the reach of others, either through their direct efforts or by orchestrating large-scale group endeavors. Their unique combination of hard technical skills and soft skills in strategy, execution, and people management enables them to navigate complex challenges and drive significant progress. By leveraging these skills, architects can move the organization forward, ensuring that the solutions they deliver are both innovative and implementable, fostering growth and development across the board.

## Pillars of Impact

Architects must possess **strong technical, people, and business skills**, which are ideally developed through extensive practice and experience. Building on this robust foundation, architects need to cultivate specific competencies that enable them to leverage their experiences and abilities to **positively impact organizational performance**. As architects advance in their careers, their competency development should be increasingly driven by the desired impact on the organization rather than solely on acquiring new skills. 

I typically coach architects within the framework of concrete activities, focusing on real-world challenges and guiding their development through hands-on involvement in appropriate actions. This practical approach helps tailor their skill development to address specific challenges and achieve the expected impact in practice.

To develop a structured approach to teach architects how to make an impact, I draw inspiration from Staff Engineering roles. Tanya Reilly's book *[The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)* and Will Larson's book *[Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/)* provide valuable insights into defining the responsibilities and expectations of architects.

***Figure 2:** Key competencies of architects. Inspired by The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly.*


Inspired by *The Staff Engineer's Path* by Tanya Reilly (Figure 2), I categorize the competencies that enable architects to make an impact into three groups:

* **Big-picture Thinking**: Architects need to develop the ability to see the broader context of their work. This type of impact involves understanding how their architectural decisions align with organizational goals, market trends, and technological advancements. Big-picture thinking allows architects to foresee potential challenges and opportunities, ensuring their designs are future-proof and scalable. This competency involves strategic planning, vision setting, and the ability to articulate how technical solutions contribute to overall business objectives.

* **Execution**: Execution is about turning ideas into reality. Architects must help teams complete projects efficiently and effectively. This type of impact involves project management skills, the ability to coordinate with cross-functional teams, and a deep understanding of the technical intricacies of bringing a project to fruition. Architects must also be capable of troubleshooting issues, adapting to changes, and ensuring that the final deliverables meet the required standards and expectations.

* **Leveling Up**: Leveling up refers to the continuous improvement of both the architect's skills and the capabilities of their teams. Architects must be committed to personal growth and the development of those around them. This type of impact involves mentoring junior team members, fostering a culture of learning, and staying abreast of the latest technological advancements and industry best practices. Architects should also focus on enhancing the overall skill set of their teams, ensuring that knowledge and expertise are shared and that the team collectively grows stronger and more capable.

By focusing on these three competency groups—big-picture thinking, execution, and leveling up—architects can significantly enhance their impact on organizational performance. This structured approach to competency development can ensure that architects are skilled practitioners and strategic leaders capable of driving meaningful change and innovation within their organizations.

### Big-Picture Thinking 

Architects are often the only individuals within an organization who possess a **"helicopter view,"** allowing them to oversee vast domains and anticipate the broader consequences of decisions. 

![](assets/images/istock/iStock-1145283550.jpg)
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

This unique perspective positions them as crucial big-picture thinkers who can contribute to the organization in several significant ways:

* **Identifying High-Leverage Points for Maximum Impact**: With their ability to see the big picture, architects can pinpoint areas within the organization where small changes or strategic investments can yield substantial benefits. This capability allows them to recommend and implement solutions that maximize impact, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently and effectively. By focusing on high-leverage points, architects can drive significant improvements in performance and productivity across the organization.

* **Helping Others to See the Big Picture**: Architects can facilitate a broader understanding of the organizational landscape among their colleagues. By helping others see the big picture, they enable more informed decision-making at all levels. They can create tools and frameworks, such as a comprehensive [Lightweight Architectural Analytics](analytics), that promote big-picture thinking. These tools help team members understand how their work fits into the larger organizational context and the impact of their contributions. Through workshops, presentations, and collaborative tools, architects can disseminate their vision, fostering a culture of strategic awareness.

* **Zooming In and Out**: Good architects have the rare ability to both maintain a strategic overview and delve into implementation details when necessary. This flexibility allows them to bridge the gap between high-level strategy and on-the-ground execution. They can provide strategic guidance while also engaging deeply with technical teams to ensure that the finer details align with broader organizational goals. This dual capability ensures that strategic initiatives are feasible and that practical implementations stay aligned with the overall vision.

* **Rooting Out Inefficiencies**: Using their big-picture perspective, architects are adept at identifying and eliminating inefficiencies within organizational processes and systems. They can lead the adoption of new technologies and processes that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of multiple teams. By doing so, architects can help streamline operations, reduce redundancies, and improve overall performance. This proactive approach to efficiency ensures that the organization remains competitive and can adapt to changing market conditions and technological advancements.

Architects play a pivotal role in organizations by leveraging their helicopter view to identify high-leverage points, help others understand the big picture, seamlessly transition between strategic and detailed thinking, and root out inefficiencies. Their ability to see and act on the broader context makes them invaluable in driving organizational success and fostering a culture of strategic innovation.

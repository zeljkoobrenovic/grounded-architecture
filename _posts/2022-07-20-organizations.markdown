In the following sections, I will introduce several resources that I use as inspiration for running the Grounded Architecture practice in complex organizations. I focus on several topics not typically covered in IT architecture literature, drawing inspiration from different sources, including social sciences, behavioral sciences, product management, and political sciences:

* **[Cooperation-Based Organizations: Six Simple Rules](six-simple-rules)**: Six Simple Rules emphasize that, in today's complicated business environments, you need to set up organizational structures based on cooperation. To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating to utilize the organization's capabilities to cope with complex problems.
* **[Product-Led Organizations](product)**: When it comes to product development, I generally recommend two resources for architects: "Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value" by Melissa Perri and "The Discipline of Market Leader," by Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema. 
* **[Organizational Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates](governance)**: I promote a technology governance model combining three governing styles: nudging; taxes (economic incentives); mandates, and bans.

A **career path** is all about the journey you take in your professional life, reflecting the roles and responsibilities you take on along the way. In any field, you might find this path to be **linear**, with a straightforward climb through positions, or **non-linear**, where you make lateral moves, dive deeper into a specialization, or even switch to different areas altogether. Both approaches offer valuable growth opportunities—what matters most is aligning your career path with your personal goals, skills, and the environment you're in.

In this section, let's chat about the **various career trajectories** available to IT architects. Whether you're keen on becoming a technical expert or aiming for a strategic leadership role, there are plenty of avenues to explore. I'll discuss how architects can grow within their current roles, move up to leadership positions, or even pivot into related fields like product management, operations, or executive management.

If you're looking for practical tools and tips on managing, developing, or hiring architects, be sure to check out the **Appendix**—it's packed with helpful resources.

## Solid Engineering Background

My perspective on architecture is rooted in a **strong engineering foundation**—and for good reason. In my experience, the most effective architects tend to have a **robust engineering background**.

While there are always exceptions, architects lacking substantial hands-on experience in software development often struggle to make sound technical decisions and build credibility with engineering teams.

### Why Engineering Experience Matters

Architects with a solid foundation in software engineering bring more than just technical knowledge—they bring **practical wisdom**. They have written code, debugged systems, managed technical debt, and experienced production outages. This firsthand experience enables them to:

* **Make realistic decisions** based on the constraints and trade-offs of real-world systems,
* **Select appropriate technologies and patterns**, not merely based on trends, but on the specific context,
* **Identify potential pitfalls and technical challenges** before they become delivery risks.

This type of experience is not theoretical—it is gained through time spent in the field. Consequently, engineers are far more likely to trust and follow the guidance of architects who have shared that journey.



### Bridging Vision and Execution

A solid engineering foundation also enhances an architect's ability to **communicate effectively with development teams**. Architects who are fluent in the technical language and culture of engineering can bridge the gap between high-level architectural vision and the day-to-day realities of implementation. They don't just design solutions—they **collaborate on them**, guiding teams without micromanaging or over-specifying.

### Thinking Like an Engineer

Engineers are trained to:

* **Analyze deeply,**
* **Think critically,**
* **Solve complex, interdependent problems.**

These skills are essential for architects, who must evaluate trade-offs, navigate ambiguity, and devise solutions that are both technically sound and aligned with business goals.

While becoming a great architect involves learning to think strategically, communicate cross-functionally, and lead with influence, the **foundation is engineering**. Without it, architecture risks becoming disconnected from implementation—an abstract exercise with minimal practical impact.

In short: **real influence starts with real experience.** An engineering foundation not only enhances architects' credibility but also their capability.

<br>
## Entering the Architecture Space

While a **strong engineering foundation** is essential, transitioning into an architecture role requires more than just technical proficiency. The shift from engineer to architect involves a significant expansion in focus, responsibilities, and skill sets. Architects work at the intersection of **technology, business, and people**, and succeeding in this role depends on adapting to that broader context.

![Stepping into architecture](assets/images/istock/iStock-529522453.jpg)

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/vm">vm</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

Here are the three key shifts that define this transition:

### 1. Broader Scope

Engineers often concentrate on specific components or features. In contrast, architects must adopt a **system-wide perspective**. This includes:

* Considering the interactions between services, systems, and platforms,
* Understanding how different parts interact, scale, and evolve,
* Balancing performance, security, reliability, and cost across the architecture.

Architects are responsible for designing **cohesive, scalable solutions** that not only fit the technical landscape but also align with the **strategic and operational context** of the organization.

### 2. Higher Diversity

The architectural role comes with **greater variation** in both the types of work and the people you collaborate with. This includes:

* A broader array of technologies and system types,
* Exposure to business processes, compliance concerns, and customer requirements,
* Collaboration with cross-functional teams—from developers and designers to executives and finance professionals.

This diversity requires versatility. Architects must be able to **context-switch,** communicate across disciplines, and apply **systems thinking** to tackle complex and often ambiguous problems.

### 3. Changing Skillset

Perhaps the most significant change is the increased emphasis on **communication and influence**. Architects must:

* Translate technical concepts into business value,
* Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders,
* Build trust, **facilitate decision-making**, and align teams around a shared vision.

People skills—such as empathy, negotiation, and storytelling—become as crucial as technical expertise. Without these skills, even the best technical solutions may struggle to gain traction or deliver value.


### The Role in Context

Architects must be **multifaceted professionals**—grounded in engineering, fluent in business, and skilled in stakeholder engagement. It's not enough to know how to build systems; architects must also understand **why those systems matter** and **how they support strategic goals**.

The transition into architecture is not merely a promotion—it's a **paradigm shift**. It represents a move from solving problems in code to addressing challenges in systems, teams, and organizations. Those who embrace this expanded scope will find architecture to be a uniquely challenging and rewarding discipline.

### Specialized Track – Principal Architect

Principal Architects evolve from senior roles into **deep subject-matter experts**. They:

* Own and advance a particular domain (e.g., data, distributed systems, frontend architecture).
* Provide **thought leadership** and establish a long-term vision.
* Define standards and best practices.
* Mentor engineers and other architects in their specialty.

This track is ideal for those who prefer to **go deep rather than broad** and want to shape the future of key architectural pillars.

### Enterprise Track – Enterprise Architect

Enterprise Architects operate at the intersection of **technology and business strategy**. They:

* Collaborate closely with senior engineering and business leaders.
* Align architectural decisions with strategic goals.
* Navigate cross-functional initiatives that span departments and domains.
* Shape and communicate the long-term technology vision for the organization.

This track is suited for architects who enjoy thinking **systemically**, influencing organizational structure, and driving large-scale transformation.


### Evolving Beyond Titles

While job titles and tracks provide helpful structure, **true career progression in architecture is about increasing impact**. The most successful architects are those who:

* Continuously learn and adapt.
* Build trust and credibility across teams.
* Drive innovation that aligns with real business needs.
* Translate abstract strategy into actionable execution.

Whether they hold a specific title or not, these architects play a **critical role in the success of their teams and organizations**. Their career path is defined less by hierarchy and more by **the value they create** and the problems they solve.

<br>
## Career Progression Beyond IT Architecture

A career in IT architecture often serves as a **launchpad into senior technology leadership roles**, such as **Engineering Director**, **Head of Technology**, or **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**. This progression is both natural and achievable, as the skills and experiences gained in architectural roles closely align with the demands of executive leadership.

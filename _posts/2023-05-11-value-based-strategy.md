As IT architects, we often focus on designing scalable, secure, and efficient systems. However, true architectural success comes from **aligning IT strategy with business value creation**. Felix Oberholzer-Gee’s article, “[**Eliminate Strategic Overload**](https://hbr.org/2021/05/eliminate-strategic-overload),” introduces a **value-based strategy**, which simplifies strategic decision-making by focusing on initiatives that create substantial **value for customers, employees, and suppliers**. This concept directly relates to IT architecture, underscoring how **technology decisions** should support **overarching business goals**.


<br>
## Key Elements of Value-Based Strategy

At its core, value-based strategy focuses on three key elements:  

1. Creating **value for customers** by raising their willingness to pay (WTP).  
2. Creating **value for employees** by making work more appealing.  
3. Creating **value for suppliers** by reducing their operating costs.

***Figure 1:** Value-based strategy focuses on three key elements.*

<br>

### Creating Value for Customers by Raising Willingness to Pay (WTP)

Businesses thrive when they deliver exceptional experiences that make customers value their products more—leading them to pay higher prices. A strong IT architecture enables this by powering digital innovations such as:

* **Personalized recommendations** (e.g., Netflix suggesting shows tailored to viewing history),
* **Frictionless user experiences** (e.g., Amazon’s one-click purchasing),
* **Reliable digital services** (e.g., mobile banking apps that are available 24/7).

These IT-driven capabilities increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, thereby raising their willingness to pay.

### Creating Value for Employees by Making Work More Appealing

A productive, engaging work environment helps retain talent and boost performance. Organizations can achieve this by:

* **Automating repetitive tasks** (e.g., using RPA tools to handle invoice processing),
* **Providing intuitive digital tools** (e.g., Google Workspace for collaboration),
* **Supporting hybrid work models** (e.g., secure remote access through VPNs and cloud-based apps).

Robust IT architecture ensures these solutions are scalable, secure, and user-friendly—making daily work more enjoyable and efficient.

### Creating Value for Suppliers by Reducing Their Operating Costs

Collaborative partnerships with suppliers flourish when businesses help improve their efficiency. This can be done through:

* **Streamlined logistics systems** (e.g., real-time tracking via IoT sensors),
* **Data sharing for demand forecasting** (e.g., Walmart sharing POS data with suppliers),
* **Self-service supplier portals** (e.g., automated invoice submission and status tracking).

These capabilities rely on integrated IT systems that facilitate transparency, speed, and accuracy—reducing costs and strengthening supplier relationships.


<br>
## Creating Technology Ecosystem For Business Success

By **embedding these principles into IT architecture**, enterprises can create a technology ecosystem directly contributing to business success.

IT leaders should move beyond technical efficiency and align architectures with strategic value creation by:  

1. **Simplifying technology stacks** to focus on fewer impactful systems.  
2. **Enhancing customer experiences** through well-architected digital platforms.  
3. **Improving employee work conditions** with automation and seamless IT experiences.  
4. **Optimizing supplier interactions** through smart supply chain solutions.  
5. **Building ecosystems and complements** with flexible, API-driven architectures.  
6. **Enabling business model shifts** by designing adaptable IT infrastructures.  


By adopting **value-based strategy principles**, **IT architects** ensure that technology is not just an **operational enabler** but a **core driver of business value**.

<br>
### Reducing Complexity: Focusing on Fewer, High-Impact IT Initiatives

Modern enterprises face **strategic overload**, where multiple competing initiatives **dilute impact**. IT architecture often mirrors this complexity, with organizations maintaining **redundant systems**, **fragmented data strategies**, and **competing technology stacks**. Value-based strategy teaches that organizations should prioritize **fewer, high-impact initiatives** that **maximize value**. Enterprise architects should **streamline technology portfolios**, eliminating redundancies and focusing on platforms that create tangible business value.

For instance, instead of maintaining multiple CRMs across business units, a **unified CRM** that enhances **customer experience** and integrates with other functions increases *willingness to pay (WTP)*.

<br>
### Creating Value for Customers Through IT

The article emphasizes that companies succeed by increasing customers’ *willingness to pay (WTP)* through **enhanced product appeal** and **user experience**. IT architecture enables **frictionless digital interactions**, **personalization**, and **high system availability**. **Cloud-native architectures**, **AI-driven recommendations**, and **omnichannel experiences** contribute to higher WTP.

For example, **Netflix’s personalized recommendation engine** boosts customer retention by improving engagement and perceived value.

<br>
### Enhancing Employee Experience Through IT

Value-based strategy also highlights improving employee conditions to reduce their *willingness to sell (WTS)*—making jobs **more appealing**. IT architecture supports this through **better tools**, **automation**, and **flexible work arrangements**. Enterprise systems should emphasize **user-friendly interfaces**, **automation**, and **collaboration tools** to improve **productivity** and **satisfaction**.

For instance, DevOps pipelines and infrastructure-as-code streamline deployment, making engineers more productive and engaged.

<br>
### Optimizing Supplier Relationships with Technology

Companies create value by lowering suppliers’ WTS, reducing their **operating costs** and improving **partnerships**. IT architecture supports this through **efficient procurement**, **automated supply chains**, and **data-driven insights**.

Example: **Nike’s lean manufacturing training**, backed by analytics, cut costs and improved margins for both Nike and its suppliers.

<br>
### Leveraging IT to Create Complementary Value

Value-based organizations seek **complements**—products or services that **enhance the core offering**. IT architecture should enable this via **APIs** and **platform-based ecosystems**.

For example, Apple’s integrated ecosystem (iPhones, App Store, iCloud) increases **customer stickiness** by delivering seamless complementary services.

<br>
### Shifting Profit Pools with IT-Enabled Business Models

As industries evolve, companies must shift their **profit pools**—redirecting value capture to **adjacent services**. **Adaptive IT architectures** support these strategic pivots. Cloud computing, **SaaS models**, and **AI insights** help businesses transform.

Example: Microsoft’s transition from Windows licenses to a **cloud-based subscription model** (Azure, Office 365) showcases a profit pool shift enabled by IT.

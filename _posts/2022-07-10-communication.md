## So What!

**"So What? How to Communicate What Really Matters to Your Audience"** by Mark Magnacca is an essential guide for IT and software architects who must effectively communicate their ideas and solutions to stakeholders, team members, and clients. This book emphasizes the importance of delivering clear, concise, and relevant messages that resonate with the audience's needs and concerns. By applying the principles outlined in "So What!", IT professionals can enhance their communication skills, ensuring their technical insights are understood and valued.

### Key Concepts from the Book

The book emphasizes several crucial concepts for effective communication. It begins by stressing the importance of **knowing your audience**; understanding their interests, concerns, and motivations is foundational. It also highlights the necessity of focusing on the **"So What?" factor**, urging communicators always to clarify the relevance of their messages and why the audience should care. **Clarity and conciseness** are essential—messages should be delivered straightforwardly and avoiding jargon and complex terms.

Furthermore, the **use of stories and analogies** is recommended to make technical concepts more relatable and easier to understand. Keeping the **audience engaged** is another critical point; interactive communication helps maintain interest and promotes better understanding. Finally, **preparation and practice** are essential; rehearsing your communication not only ensures clarity but also builds confidence in your delivery.

Mark Magnacca also provides practical tips on communicating different types of messages. He describes [various kinds of storylines](https://obren.io/tools/sowhat/) you can use to communicate almost any topic:

* **Action Jackson:** A simple storyline describing steps. Use when you want to spell out an action plan. Build to map overall recommendations and supporting steps. Avoid when the audience still needs to be convinced.
* **The Pitch:** Articulates and supports a recommendation. Use when you need to persuade someone. Highlights your value proposition 'right up front.'. Avoid being glib; your supporting reasons must convince your audience.
* **Traffic Light:** Use it for status updates. It enables you to provide an overview and explain your current position in as much detail as you want. Avoid being sloppy.
* **Close the Gap:** Use it to gain your audience's buy-in in one meeting. Explain where you are and where you need to get.
  Build it to outline the case for your action plan. Stick to storyline rules so your audience supports your action
  plan.
* **Houston, We Have a Problem:** Use when you need to convince an audience of a problem and talk them through actions.
  Great at combining diagnostics and action. Maps problems, the cause, and resulting steps. Avoid overkill, it is about convincing.
* **To B, or Not to B:** Use to take your audience on the journey through your thinking. It argues for one particular option. It enables you to explain first and then make recommendations last. Make sure it's complete - great when you need to work through all options, not just one option you like.
* **Watch Out:** This storyline persuades the audience of the need to change direction. It combines what's working, risks, and action in the same story. Maps what's succeeded, the risks, and remedies. Avoid crafting a narrative that flows without compelling logic.

"So What!" by Mark Magnacca offers a framework that IT and software architects can use to enhance their communication skills. By understanding their audience, focusing on the relevance of their message, and using clear, engaging communication techniques, IT professionals can ensure their technical insights are effectively understood and valued. Applying these principles can lead to better project outcomes, improved team dynamics, and stronger stakeholder relationships.

### Examples

Here are a few examples of how you could use "So What!" techniques in IT practice:

#### **Scenario 1**: Justifying the development team's adoption of a new software development methodology.

Understand that developers might be worried about learning new processes and potential disruptions. You might say, "I know that adopting a new methodology can be daunting and may disrupt our current workflow." Highlight the benefits relevant to them: "This new methodology will streamline our development process, making it easier to manage projects and deliver high-quality software faster." Simplify the explanation: "It's a more efficient way to develop software, reducing bugs and improving collaboration." Use stories and analogies: "Imagine if we had a clear, organized roadmap for every project. It would save us time and reduce confusion." Encourage participation and discussion: "How do you think this methodology could help us? What challenges do you foresee?" Practice presenting the new methodology to address
potential questions and concerns effectively.

#### **Scenario 2**: Convincing the team to prioritize code quality over speed.

Recognize that developers may be under pressure to deliver quickly. You could say, "I know you're all feeling the pressure to deliver features quickly." Explain the importance of code quality: "Prioritizing code quality now will save us time and effort in the long run by reducing bugs and maintenance." Keep it simple: "Good code now means fewer problems later." Use stories and analogies: "It's like building a house. If the foundation is strong, we won't have to fix cracks in the walls later." Ask for their input and concerns: "What challenges do you face when writing high-quality code? How can we support you?" Be ready to present examples and data supporting the importance of code quality.

#### **Scenario 3**: Proposing the integration of a new tool to improve workflow efficiency.

Understand that team members might be skeptical about new tools. You might say, "I know new tools can sometimes seem more hassle than they're worth." Emphasize the tool's benefits: "This tool will automate repetitive tasks, giving you more time to focus on complex problems and innovation." Be direct: "Handling the boring stuff makes your job easier." Use stories and analogies: "Consider it as getting a personal assistant to handle your paperwork so you can focus on your real work." Involve them in the decision: "Would you be willing to try this tool for a week and give feedback on its impact?" Demonstrate the tool's features and prepare to answer questions.

#### **Scenario 4**: Addressing the need for better documentation practices.

Recognize that developers might see documentation as tedious. You might say, "I understand that documenting your work can feel like a chore." Highlight the long-term benefits: "Good documentation will make it easier for everyone to understand and work with the code, reducing future headaches." Simplify the message: "Documenting now saves us time and confusion later." Use stories and analogies: "It's like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for others to follow, making it easier for everyone to find their way." Seek their ideas on improving documentation: "What tools or practices would make documentation easier for us?" Provide examples of good documentation and its positive impact on projects.

#### **Scenario 5**: Presenting the benefits of refactoring legacy code.

Understand the reluctance to change something that works. You might say, "I know the legacy code has been working fine, and changing it might seem risky." Explain the benefits of refactoring: "Refactoring will improve performance, make the codebase easier to maintain, and reduce bugs." Be straightforward: "Updating the old code makes it better and easier to work with." Use stories and analogies: "Think of it as renovating an old house. It preserves what's good while making it more livable." Get their thoughts on refactoring: "What concerns do you have about refactoring? How can we address them?" Show examples of successful refactoring projects and their benefits.

#### **Scenario 6**: Encouraging open communication within the team.

Recognize that team members might be hesitant to speak up. You could say, "I know it can be difficult to share honest feedback, especially if it's critical." Emphasize the value of open communication: "Open communication helps us identify problems early and work together to solve them, leading to a more effective and happier team." Keep it simple: "Speaking up helps us all improve." Use stories and analogies: "It's like having a map on a journey. When everyone shares what they know, we can avoid obstacles and reach our destination faster." Encourage participation: "What can we do to make it easier for everyone to share their thoughts?" Foster an environment where feedback is regularly shared and valued.

## Radical Candor

**"Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity"** by Kim Scott is an invaluable resource for IT and software architects who lead teams and engage in critical conversations. The book provides a framework for giving and receiving feedback, building strong relationships, and fostering a culture of open communication. These principles can greatly enhance team dynamics, project efficiency, and overall job satisfaction in IT and software development
environments.

</div>

### Key Concepts from the Book

Scott defines a feedback-providing communication framework as having two access points: the directness of challenge and the amount of personal caring. Based on this framework, she defines four quedradns of:

- **Radical Candor**: Caring personally while challenging directly.
- **Ruinous Empathy**: Caring personally without challenging directly.
- **Obnoxious Aggression**: Challenging directly without caring personally.
- **Manipulative Insincerity**: Neither caring personally nor challenging directly.

Radical Candor is the only positive option, which happens when you:
1. **Care Personally**: Show genuine concern for your team members' well-being and career growth.
2. **Challenge Directly**: Provide honest, straightforward feedback to help team members improve.

"Radical Candor" offers a framework that IT and software architects can use to enhance their leadership and communication skills. By applying Scott's principles of caring personally and challenging directly, IT professionals can build stronger teams, foster a culture of continuous improvement, and drive successful project outcomes. The contrasting examples from other quadrants (Ruinous Empathy, Obnoxious Aggression, and Manipulative Insincerity) illustrate the importance of balancing care and directness to achieve the best results.


### Examples

Here are a few examples you could use to get inspiration onhow tu use Radical Candor in IT practice:

#### **Scenario 1**: Providing feedback on a poorly designed system architecture.

With Radical Candor, begin by acknowledging the hard work the team has put into the current design. "I appreciate the effort everyone has invested in this project. However, I've noticed some scalability concerns that we need to address. Let's look at how we can refactor the design to handle increased load better." In contrast, Ruinous Empathy might sound like, "Great job on the design, everyone. Let's not worry too much about scalability issues right now; we'll figure it out later." Obnoxious Aggression would be, "This design is terrible. How could you miss these scalability issues? We need to fix this immediately." Manipulative Insincerity would come across as "I guess the design is okay, but there
might be some minor scalability issues. Do whatever you think is best."

#### **Scenario 2**: Addressing technical debt and its impact on future projects.

Using Radical Candor, you could say, "I know everyone has been working tirelessly to meet our deadlines. We need to allocate time to reduce our technical debt. It will hinder our future development and slow us down if we don't address it now." On the other hand, Ruinous Empathy might be, "You all have worked so hard; let's not worry about technical debt right now. We can deal with it later." Obnoxious Aggression would sound like, "The technical debt is getting out of control. This is unacceptable, and we need to fix it now." With Manipulative Insincerity, you might say, "There might be
some technical debt, but it's not a big deal. Just keep doing what you're doing."

#### **Scenario 3**: Providing feedback to a team member who consistently writes inefficient code.

Radical Candor might involve saying, "I've noticed you're very dedicated to your work and always eager to help. However, I've seen some inefficiencies in your code that we need to improve. Let's work together to optimize it and follow best practices." Ruinous Empathy would be, "You're doing a great job, keep it up! We can look at the code optimization some other time." Obnoxious Aggression could sound like, "Your code is inefficient and needs to be fixed immediately. This is not acceptable." Manipulative Insincerity might be, "Your code is fine, but there might be a few inefficiencies. It's not a big deal, though."

#### **Scenario 4**: Discussing the adoption of new coding standards with the team.

With Radical Candor, you could say, "You all have done an excellent job adapting to new standards and technologies in the past. To maintain code quality and ensure consistency, we need to adopt these new coding standards. I understand it's an additional effort, but it will benefit us in the long run." Ruinous Empathy might be, "You're all doing great; there's no need to change our coding standards right now." Obnoxious Aggression would be, "We need to adopt these new coding standards immediately. I don't care how much extra work it is." Manipulative Insincerity would come across as," These new coding standards are optional. Use them if you want, but it's not a big deal if you don't."

#### **Scenario 5**: Addressing a conflict between team members regarding code ownership.

Using Radical Candor, you might say, "I appreciate the hard work both of you have put into this project. There seems to be some tension regarding code ownership. Let's discuss how we can collaborate more effectively and ensure everyone's contributions are recognized." Ruinous Empathy would be, "You're both doing great work; let's not worry about who owns what code. It's not important." Obnoxious Aggression could be, "This conflict over code ownership is ridiculous. Figure it out or I'll reassign the tasks." Manipulative Insincerity might be, "I'm not sure whose code is whose, but just try to get along and make it work."

#### **Scenario 6**: Encouraging a junior developer to take on more challenging tasks.

With Radical Candor, you could say, "I've seen a lot of potential in your work, and you've grown significantly since joining the team. I'd like to see you take on some more challenging tasks. It might be tough at first, but I believe it will help you develop your skills further." Ruinous Empathy might sound like, "You're doing well; no need to take on more challenging tasks right now. Just keep doing what you're comfortable with." Obnoxious Aggression would be, "You need to take on more challenging tasks. Stop taking the easy way out." Manipulative Insincerity would be, "You could try
some more challenging tasks if you want, but it's fine if you don't feel up to it."

#### **Scenario 7**: Managing unrealistic project expectations from upper management.

Using Radical Candor, you might say, "I know there's a lot of pressure to deliver quickly in a competitive market.
However, the current expectations are unrealistic given our resources. We must discuss what can be realistically achieved within the given timeframe and how we can adjust our approach." Ruinous Empathy would be, "We'll try our best to meet the deadlines, even if it's unrealistic." Obnoxious Aggression could be, "These expectations are completely unrealistic and unachievable. We can't do it." Manipulative Insincerity might be, "Sure, we'll do our best to meet the deadlines, but it might be tough."

#### **Scenario 8**: Fostering a culture of open feedback within the team.

With Radical Candor, you could say, "I want everyone to know that your contributions are highly valued and your
well-being is important to me. To grow as a team, we need to be open and honest with each other. Please feel free to share your thoughts and feedback, whether positive or critical, so we can continuously improve." Ruinous Empathy might be, "Everyone's doing great, so there's no need for much feedback. Let's keep things as they are." Obnoxious Aggression would be, "We need to be brutally honest with each other. If you can't handle criticism, this isn't your place." Manipulative Insincerity might be, "Feel free to share your feedback if you want, but it's not a big deal if you don't."

</div>

### Key Concepts from the Book

The books apply several key concepts and techniques you can use in difficult negotiations:

1. **Tactical Empathy**: Understanding and actively listening to the counterpart's perspective to build rapport and trust.
2. **Mirroring**: Repeating the last few words the other person said to encourage them to elaborate.
3. **Labeling**: Identifying and acknowledging the other person's feelings to validate their emotions.
4. **Accusation Audit**: Preemptively addressing any negative assumptions the other party might have.
5. **Calibrated Questions**: Asking open-ended questions that begin with "What" or "How" to steer conversations and gather information.
6. **The Power of No**: Understanding that hearing "No" can be a pathway to uncovering the real issues and fostering a sense of control for the other party.

"Never Split the Difference" offers valuable techniques for IT and software architects to enhance their negotiation skills, enabling them to navigate difficult conversations and achieve favorable outcomes. By applying Voss's strategies, IT professionals can address concerns, build consensus, and drive successful implementation of critical architectural changes.


### Examples

Here are a few examples you could use to get inspiration on how to use described techniques in IT practice:

#### **Scenario 1**: Convincing stakeholders to adopt a new cloud architecture.

Use Tactical Empathy by understanding the concerns of stakeholders who may worry about data security or cost
implications. You might say, "It sounds like you are concerned about the security of our data in the cloud." Employ Mirroring when a stakeholder says, "I'm worried about the cost," by responding, "The cost?" Utilize Labeling by saying, "It seems like you're feeling uncertain about the transition." Conduct an Accusation Audit with, "You might think this is going to be too expensive and risky, and I understand why you'd feel that way." Ask Calibrated Questions such as, "What are the main challenges you see with moving to the cloud?" or "How can we ensure our data remains secure?" Finally, use The Power of No: "Would it be a ridiculous idea to explore a hybrid model?"

#### **Scenario 2**: Negotiating adopting a new software development methodology.

Recognize the team's attachment to the current methodology with Tactical Empathy: "I see that you've been very comfortable with our current Agile practices." When a team member says, "I don't think this new methodology will work," respond with Mirroring: "Won't work?" When they elaborate, continue mirroring their key phrases to draw more details. For example, if the team member says, "Yes, it's too different from what we're used to," respond, "Too different from what we're used to?" When they add, "Yes, we have established routines and this new approach will disrupt them," say, "Established routines and disruptions?" This might lead to, "Yes, we're worried that it will slow down our progress and make us less efficient initially." Label their concerns with, "It sounds like you're worried that this change will lead to inefficiencies and slow down our progress." Perform an Accusation Audit, stating, "You might think this change is unnecessary and disruptive." Use Calibrated Questions like, "What steps can we take to ensure this new methodology integrates smoothly with our existing processes?" or "How do you see this change improving our current workflow?" Use The Power of No with, "Is it a terrible idea to pilot this methodology on a smaller project first?"

#### **Scenario 3**: Negotiating deadlines with the product management team.

Show Tactical Empathy by understanding the pressure the product management team might be under to deliver on time: "It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure to meet these deadlines." Use Mirroring when a product manager says, "We need this feature by the end of the month," by responding, "By the end of the month?" When they say, "Yes, the marketing team has already planned a campaign around it," you might respond with, "Planned a campaign?" They might elaborate, "Yes, and if we miss the deadline, it will throw everything off." Follow up with, "Throw everything off?" leading to, "Yes, it will affect our quarterly targets." Label this by saying, "It seems like you're worried about how delays might affect the quarterly targets." Perform an Accusation Audit with, "You might think the engineering team is slow and unresponsive to deadlines." Use Calibrated Questions such as, "What can we do to ensure the most critical features are delivered on time?" or "How can we prioritize tasks to meet your needs without compromising quality?" Use The Power of No: "Would it be unreasonable to extend the deadline by two weeks to ensure the feature is fully tested?"

#### **Scenario 4**: Convincing a team to refactor legacy code.

Show Tactical Empathy by understanding the team's attachment to the existing codebase and the fear of extensive changes: "It sounds like you're concerned about the potential risks of changing the existing codebase." Use Mirroring when a team member says, "The legacy code works fine as it is," by responding, "Works fine as it is?" When they say, "Yes, we haven't had any major issues with it," respond with, "No major issues?" When they add, "Right, and changing it might introduce new problems," you could say, "Introduce new problems?" leading to, "Yes, and we're not sure if the benefits are worth the risks." Label this by saying, "It sounds like you're worried that refactoring might introduce new problems and the benefits might not be worth the risks." Perform an Accusation Audit by stating, "You might think this refactor is just going to be a huge time sink without much benefit." Use Calibrated Questions such as, "What are the biggest risks you see with refactoring the legacy code?" or "How can we ensure the refactor improves performance without disrupting current functionality?" Use The Power of No: "Would it be a bad idea to refactor the code in small, manageable sections?"

#### **Scenario 5**: Gaining team buy-in for adopting a new technology stack.

Show Tactical Empathy by understanding the team's hesitation towards learning and integrating new technologies: "It sounds like you're concerned about the learning curve associated with this new technology." Use Mirroring when a team member says, "I don't see the need for this change," by responding, "Don't see the need?" When they say, "Yes, our current stack is working fine for us," respond with, "Working fine for us?" When they add, "Yes, we're familiar with it, and it meets our needs," you could say, "Meets our needs?" leading to, "Yes, switching to something new would be a hassle." Label this by saying, "It sounds like you're worried about the hassle of switching to a new technology, and you feel the current stack meets our needs." Perform an Accusation Audit by stating, "You might think this new technology will be too complex and time-consuming to adopt." Use Calibrated Questions such as, "What are the main challenges you anticipate with adopting this new technology?" or "How can we support the team to make the transition smoother?" Use The Power of No: "Would it be a terrible idea to start with a small, non-critical project to evaluate the benefits of the new stack?"

#### **Scenario 6**: Managing unrealistic project timelines imposed by senior management.

Show Tactical Empathy by understanding senior management's pressures regarding market competition and business goals: "It sounds like there's significant pressure to meet market demands quickly." Use Mirroring when a senior manager says, "We need the project completed in three months," by responding, "Three months?" When they say, "Yes, any longer, and we risk falling behind our competitors," they respond with, "Falling behind competitors?" When they add, "Yes, we must launch before they do," you could say, "Launch before they do?" leading to, "Yes, to capture the market share we're targeting." Label this by saying, "It sounds like you're worried about losing market share if we take longer." Perform an Accusation Audit, stating, "You might think we're not committed to meeting the company's goals." Use Calibrated Questions such as, "How can we ensure that the quality of the project is not compromised while aiming for a faster timeline?" or "What are the most critical features that need to be prioritized to meet this deadline?" Use The Power of No: "How am I supposed to deliver a high-quality, fully-tested product in three months with the current resources and constraints?"

The last example, "How am I supposed to do that?" is a calibrated question designed to make the other party reconsider the feasibility of their demand and encourage a more realistic and collaborative discussion about what can be achieved. This approach helps negotiate more reasonable timelines or secure additional resources to meet tight deadlines.

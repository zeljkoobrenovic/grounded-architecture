excerpt: "Our aim was to keep architectural decision-making distributed across the organization embedded in the local units. Local units traditionally have the best insights and most information relevant for making a decision. As Gregor Hohpe mentioned, the worst case of organizational decision-making happens when people with relevant information do not have the mandate to make decisions, while people who lack sufficient information can make all decisions."

The first of our aims was to keep architectural decision-making distributed across the organization embedded in the local units. Local units traditionally have the best insights and most information relevant for making a decision. As Gregor Hohpe mentioned, the worst case of organizational decision-making happens when people with relevant information do not have the mandate to make decisions, while people who lack sufficient information can make all decisions.

As a part of distributed decision-making goal, we also wanted to embrace architectural diversity. Our organizational units have very diverse structures and sizes. There is no one-fit-all solution about how departments should assign architecture responsibilities. We generally accepted three types of architectural structures in line with Gregor Hohpe's view of architects and their teams' relationships. That means that some units have lead architects coordinating or leading multiple teams. We often have cases where an architect was a full-time member of a team working over specific products or other features. We also have themes that did not have an architect but several senior developers making architectural decisions.

We wanted to make explicit that every unit needs to have some attention or ways of making architectural decisions rather than having them simply happen. If no one is consciously performing the task of architecture, the result is often excessive complexity and reduced velocity, meaning the teams come to a grinding halt.

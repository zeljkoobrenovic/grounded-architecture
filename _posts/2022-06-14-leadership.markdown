My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet's work and the Netflix's valued behaviors. [David Marquet's work](https://davidmarquet.com/)  (e.g., "Turn the Ship Around!") developes ideas of empowerment, clarity, decentralization, continuous improvement, and servant leadership. [Netflix overview of their valued behaviors](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) is a helpful guide for how I coach and develop architects according to the superglue version.

## David Marquet's Work: The Leader-Leader Model

Marquet's work is closely related to the Leader-Leader model, which is a leadership approach where authority is shared across a team or organization rather than being concentrated at the top. Everyone on the team has something valuable to offer and can contribute to the group's success.

The leader-leader model empowers individuals to take ownership of their work and collaborate with others to achieve common goals. Instead of relying on a single leader to make all the decisions, authority and responsibility are distributed across the team.

The leader-leader model is an excellent standard for architect's leadership vision. Like managers in a leader-leader model, architects should act more as facilitators, coaches, and mentors than traditional top-down decision-makers. They provide team members guidance, support, or resources to help them achieve their goals and reach their full potential.

One of the key benefits of a leader-leader model is that it creates a more collaborative and inclusive work environment. It allows individuals to contribute their unique perspectives, experiences, and skills to the group and promotes a sense of ownership and accountability for the team's success. This model also helps build trust and stronger relationships within the team, leading to increased productivity, creativity, and innovation.

David Marquet’s view from “Leadership is Language” can also help introducing the leader-leader model in the architecture work. This work emphasizes the importance of language and communication in leadership and provides practical advice for leaders looking to create a more collaborative, innovative, and inclusive organizational culture. David Marquet introduced the phrase “I intend to” as a powerful tool for clarifying intent and empowering team members. Rather than requiring team members to ask an architect for instructions or permission to take a specific course of action, allowing them to tell or document (e.g., via ADRs) what they intend to do is better. When team members give intent, the psychological ownership of those actions shifts to them. They become the originators of thought and direction as opposed to passive followers. The figure bellow illustrates this language shift.

## Netflix Valued Behaviors: Leadership Behaviors

I have found the [Netflix overview of their valued behaviors](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) to be a leading inspiration for how I coach and develop architects according to the superglue version. The following sections summarize these behaviors, borrowing from the Netflix original values but rearranging them in the order I see as more relevant for architects. 

### Communication

Architects can only be successful if they are effective communicators. More specifically, as an architect, you need to have the following communication traits:

* You are **concise** and articulate in **speech and writing**
* You **listen well** and **seek to understand** before reacting
* You maintain **calm poise in stressful situations** to draw out the clearest thinking
* You **adapt your communication style** to work well with people from around the world who may not share your native language

### Judgment

People frequently call architects to be objective judges when others cannot agree or need an objective second opinion. As an architect, you'll be able to make sound judgments if:

* You are good at using **data to inform your intuition**
* You make wise **decisions** despite **ambiguity**
* You identify **root causes**, and go beyond treating symptoms
* You make decisions based on **the long term**, not near term
* You **think strategically**, and **can articulate** what you are, and are not, trying to do

### Impact

As discussed in the [Architects as Superglue](superglue), the architect's impact should be measured as a benefit for the business. Architects need to ensure that what they are making profits the company. As an architect, you need to show the following impact traits:

* You accomplish significant amounts of **important work**
* You **make your colleagues better**
* You focus on **results over process**
* You demonstrate **consistently** strong performance so **colleagues can rely upon you**

### Inclusion

As superglue, architects need to work with many different people and groups inclusively.  You will be able to do so if:

* You **collaborate** effectively with people of **diverse backgrounds and cultures**
* You nurture and **embrace differing perspectives** to make better decisions
* You **focus on talent and values**, rather than a person’s similarity to yourself
* You are **curious about how our different backgrounds affect us** at work, rather than pretending they don’t affect us

### Selflessness

Architects always need to consider the best interests of their organizations. This broader view is essential in group conflicts to enable resolutions that benefit the organization. To be able to operate in such way, you need to show the following selflessness traits:

* You seek what is **best for your organization**, rather than what is best for yourself or your group
* You **share information openly and proactively**
* You **make time to help colleagues**
* You are **open-minded** in search of the best ideas

### Courage

Being an architect is not always a comfortable position as you will need to be a part of difficult decisions many will not be happy about. You need to have enough courage to make such difficult calls. You will be able to do so if you show the following traits:

* You **say what you think** when it’s in the best interest of your organization, even if it is uncomfortable
* You are willing to be **critical of the status quo**
* You make **tough decisions** without agonizing
* You **take smart risks** and are open to possible failure
* You **question actions inconsistent** with organization's values
* You are **able to be vulnerable**, in search of truth

### Integrity

Architects need to operate as trusted advisors. Integrity is essential for such a position of architects. To operates successfully as trusted advisor, you need to show the following traits:

* You are known for **candor**, authenticity, **transparency**, and being **non-political**
* You only say things about fellow employees that you **say to their face**
* You **admit mistakes** freely and openly
* You **treat people with respect** independent of their status or disagreement with you

### Curiosity

As architects, we must proactively identify relevant new technology developments. Based on our understanding of these developments, we must create pragmatic technology recommendations for concrete platforms across the organization. That means that as architect, you need to stay curious:

* You **learn rapidly and eagerly**
* You **make connections** that others miss
* You seek **alternate perspectives**
* You **contribute effectively** outside of your specialty

### Innovation

More than curiosity is required. To make an impact, you need to create useful innovations:

* You create **new ideas** that **prove useful**
* You keep your organization nimble by **minimizing complexity** and finding time to simplify
* You **re-conceptualize issues** to discover solutions to **hard problems**
* You **challenge prevailing assumptions**, and suggest better approaches
* You **thrive on change**

### Passion

Architects are frequently role models for others. As such you need to show the following traits:

* You **inspire others** with your thirst for excellence
* You **care intensely** about your customers and organization's success
* You are **tenacious and optimistic**
* You are **quietly confident** and **openly humble**

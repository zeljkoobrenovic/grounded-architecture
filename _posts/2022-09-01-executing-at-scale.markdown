One of the main impacts of our hybrid architecture model was ability to efficiently operate at scale. Our architecture data platform supported operating a scale through automation and self-service tools. Our virtual architectural team enabled us to develop connected at all levels of the organization increasing visibility and speeding up execution of shared decisions. 

Several characteristics of our model that contributed to possibility of advocating a scale. One characteristic is having presence at multiple levels. The same characteristics is having tools that enable presentation of data at different level of obstruction and aggregation. In this way we were able to keep a helicopter view about our landscape while the same time being able to quickly zooming into details depending on the issue of your address. Zooming in and outs is one of the key characteristics of our way of working. 

## Tool Design: Zooming In, Zooming Out

We also propagated the philosophy of zooming in and out at all of our tools. On the one hand our tools enable providing complete abstracted view of the whole landscape summarizing data from all teams and groups. The same time we were able to zoom in to the details of particular systems even to the cold level. That means that we were you able to use the same tools to have sea level discussions looking at overall trends in our technology usage and costs. At the same time were able to engage with developers and really discuss concrete code fragments and potential improvements in the code level (e.g., duplicated blocks, complex units, dependencies).

## Hybrid Team Structure Supports Scalability

Our hybrid team structure all supported etiquette Nick scale. The virtual architecture team supported execution both by increasing number of people involved in architectural activities and increasing efficiency of our work by better alignment. By having members official technical team representing diverse organizational units we were able to have much more impact across the board. And having some capacity on central level serve as a catalyst helping people local levels to do their job while being aligned and better connected with overall strategic goals and other teams working with similar topics.

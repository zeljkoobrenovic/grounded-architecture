## Intro

In this collection of articles, I will explain my approach to running an architecture practice in bigger organizations. I called this approach "grounded architecture," highlighting the need for any architecture function to stay well-connected to all levels of an organization and led by data. The following figure illustrates the Grounded Architecture model, consisting of three elements:
* The Data Pillar,
* The People Pillar,
* The Strategy and Governance Platform.

The *Data Pillar* ensures that decisions architects can make data-informed decisions based on a real-time and complete overview of the state of the organization's technology.

The *People Pillar* is another essential elements of Grounded Architecture. A strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact.

Lastly, the *Strategy and Governance Platform* leverages data and people to create a data-informed, deep, and broad impact.

The rest of this site will explain in detail the grounded architecture approach. In this section, I would like to tell a few things about my motivation to write these articles.


## A Bit of Personal History

The work presented in these articles builds on several years of my experience. Most of this work results from my current work as a Chief architect at AVIV Group and previous works as a Principal Architect for eBay classifieds and Adevinta. As a chief architect in these organizations, I led different teams while working with business stakeholders to define technology roadmaps and support several strategic initiatives, such as defining a cloud, platform, and data strategy.

Another vital part of my experience that shaped these articles was my earlier experience as a consultant and analyst at the Software Improvement Group. I’ve learned the value and pragmatics of data-informed decision-making. As a spin-off of this work, I’ve also built tools called [Sokrates](sokrates.dev), which enable efficient and pragmatic extraction of data about technology and organization from source code. This work has directly influenced my view on the architecture data platform.

Lastly, my experience as a CTO of a start-up has helped me understand the difficulties and pragmatics of creating and running an IT organization.


## Why These Articles?

These articles generalize my experiences in a written form. I have written these articles for two reasons. Firstly, the act of writing helps me to clarify and improve my ideas (Figure 1). Borrowing from Gregor Hohpe, I feel I free up some brain cells to learn new things with every sentence I write. As nicely described by Hohpe written word has distinct advantages over the spoken word:

* it scales: you can address a broad audience without gathering them all in one (virtual) room at the same time
* it’s fast to process: people read 2-3 times faster than they can listen
* it can be easily searched or versioned.

***Figure 1:** Writing a book helped me organize ideas, obtain new insights, improve principles and tools, and share the lessons learned.*

Second, by generalizing and putting my experiences on paper, I hope to create more usable materials to help others in similar situations. I also expect helpful feedback from a broader community by sharing these materials.


## Who Should Read This Articles?

When writing these articles, I had a broad audience in my mind. The article should be helpful to both technical and non-technical people. I hope the article can help developers and IT architects better understand their value and place in a broader organization and collaboration possibilities with peers. I also hope the articles can show the non-technical audience, such as people with finance, marketing, and C-level management backgrounds, the benefits of staying close to and well connected with the "engine room."


## The Structure of the Site

I have organized the articles into five main parts. In this introductory part, I describe the context in which my ideas have developed. 

In the second part, I discuss the Grounded Architecture approach describing its three elements: the data pillar, the people pillar, and the technology strategy and governance platform. 

In the third part, I talk about the operating principles of Grounded Architecture. 

After that, I zoom into the main impact of well-grounded architecture, enabling operating at scale, improving decision-making quality, maximizing alignment and learning, and being highly adaptive. 

I conclude with a summary and pointers to external resources for those who want to explore more.

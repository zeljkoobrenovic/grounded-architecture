Have you ever wondered how to run an IT architecture practice without **feeling isolated in an ivory tower**, detached from your organization's people, problems, and realities?

If so, this book is for you.

Based on my experiences at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta, I introduce an approach I call **Grounded Architecture**. This **practical, human-centered method** emphasizes connecting to real-world challenges, real-time data, and real people.

Grounded Architecture is about **keeping your feet on the ground** rather than floating above the fray. It focuses on **making architecture relevant, collaborative, and responsive** to our fast-paced environments. It redefines architecture not as a set of abstract frameworks but as a living, evolving discipline rooted in relationships, results, and continuous learning.

In too many organizations, architects are viewed as distant wizards casting spells from a tower—producing documents no one reads and models no one uses. Grounded Architecture challenges that perception by **promoting an architecture practice embedded in the organization's fabric**, which is connected to strategy, delivery, operations, and, most importantly, people.

This approach places data and collaboration at the center rather than relying on heavy-handed processes or over-engineered tools. It **draws inspiration from Grounded Theory**, a research methodology that develops theories from real-world data rather than abstract ideals. In the same spirit, Grounded Architecture evolves through continuous feedback, real usage, and tangible impact—not just best practices from outdated textbooks.

Throughout this book, I will share insights, tools, and stories to help you build an architecture practice that is:

* **Collaborative**, not isolated
* **Adaptable**, not rigid
* **Outcome-oriented**, not obsessed with processes

If you're an architect, engineering leader, or technologist looking to make architecture more effective and human, this book offers a grounded path forward.


## Grounded Architecture Overview

This book introduces **Grounded Architecture**, a practical, people-centered approach to managing an IT architecture practice—especially in complex, fast-paced organizations. It is based on my experiences at **AVIV Group**, **eBay Classifieds**, and **Adevinta**, and is designed to help you overcome the stereotype of the **"architect in the ivory tower."**

Instead, this approach reimagines architecture as **deeply embedded**, **collaborative**, and **realistic**—firmly rooted in the needs of teams, data, and outcomes.

### Two Main Parts

The book is divided into two complementary sections (see *Figure 1*):

1. **Framework** – The essential components that will enable you to build your own Grounded Architecture practice.
2. **Guiding Principles** – Practical insights, tips, and inspiration to help you apply the framework effectively and sustainably.

<br>

***Figure 1:** Grounded Architecture Overview*

### The Grounded Architecture Framework

The framework consists of **three core elements**:

* **[Lightweight Architectural Analytics (Data)](analytics)**: This element enables data-informed decisions by providing accurate, up-to-date insights into your organization's technology landscape.

*  **[Collaborative Networks (People)](people)**: This emphasizes the power of relationships and peer networks to scale architectural influence and ensure shared ownership of key decisions.

* **Operating Model**: This offers the governance structures, principles, and practices that shape how architecture functions across the organization. This includes:

  * **[General Principles](operating-model):** Aligning architecture with your organization’s reality by focusing on collaboration, autonomy, and strategic alignment rather than top-down control.
  * **[Cooperation-Based Operating Model](six-simple-rules):** Inspired by *Six Simple Rules* (Morieux & Tollman), this model encourages shared accountability and flexible structures to navigate complexity.
  * **[IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates](governance):** Governance should be a **balanced mix** of soft influence (nudging), economic signals (taxes), and clear boundaries (mandates/bans).
  * **[Generative AI in Grounded Architecture](gen-ai-potential):** Based on my early explorations, this section shares practical ways to integrate GenAI tools into architectural workflows while maintaining integrity and oversight.

These components together form a **pragmatic, adaptive foundation** for modern architectural practice—grounded in **data, people, and results**.

### Guiding Principles and Inspiration (Books 2 and 3)

Before diving into the full framework, I would like to share some thoughts on **why** I wrote this book. 


## What Will You Learn?

This book is a **practical guide** to building and managing a **robust, modern IT architecture practice**. It aims to help you align with organizational goals, navigate complexity, and thrive in today's rapidly evolving IT environments.

Whether you're a practicing architect, a leader of architects, or someone working closely with them, this book will provide you with **insight, structure, and inspiration**.

### Key Topics

You'll discover useful perspectives and actionable advice on how to:

* **Create flexible organizational and technical structures** that support and scale IT architecture work.
* **Define architecture roles, skills, and career paths** to help your architects grow and succeed.
* **Operate an architecture practice effectively** in diverse, complex, and multicultural environments.
* Learn from **real-world lessons and insights** based on my experiences at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta.

### Format & Structure

I've organized this book as a **high-level "playbook"** for running an architecture practice or working as an architect. Each section introduces a topic, offers **concrete tips**, and concludes with **reflective questions** to help you apply the ideas in your context.

You can read this book **cover to cover** or dip into it based on your current needs and interests. With rich **illustrations** and conceptual visuals, it also functions as a **"coffee table book"**—perfect for team discussions, sparking conversations, or flipping through for inspiration.

### What This Book Is *Not*

This book is **not a technical manual**. It does not discuss cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, database sharding, or performance optimization in depth. While these are essential skills, they are well-covered elsewhere.

Instead, this book broadens your **architectural perspective**, helping you apply your technical knowledge to **complex organizational ecosystems**. It's written for both **hands-on architects** and those managing or supporting them.

### Is This a Proven Method?

This book isn't a prescriptive methodology, nor is it scientifically validated. It is a **personal and opinionated guide**, grounded in day-to-day experience rather than academic theory.

What I present here has been tested across **three major companies**, and while every organization is different, I believe the principles are **general enough to be reusable and practical enough to be valuable**.

In a field filled with frameworks and formal models, **real stories and tested approaches** often provide the most valuable guidance. I also encourage others to share their experiences because our discipline becomes stronger through **practical reflection and honest exchange**, rather than abstract theory.

### Who Should Read This Book?

This book is intended for:

* **IT architects** who want to enhance their impact, influence, and clarity.
* **Engineering leaders** who manage architects and wish to organize their work more effectively.
* **Business and product leaders** looking to understand the value of architecture and how to collaborate better with technical teams.

I designed it to be **accessible to both technical and non-technical readers**, and useful whether you're building a practice from scratch or refining an existing one.

### Applying Ideas in Practice: Architecture as Cooking

I like to think of starting or improving an architecture practice as a form of **culinary art**.

Imagine arriving at a new company like a chef stepping into an unfamiliar kitchen, carrying a suitcase filled with your favorite tools and spices. Your most important work comes next: discovering the **local ingredients**.

![](assets/images/istock/iStock-1409729992.jpg)
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

Great cooking depends on what's fresh and available, but great architecture relies on **your organization's people, culture, and context**. Your frameworks and experience provide structure, but the authentic flavor comes from your team: their skills, insights, and unique organizational knowledge.

While I'll share recipes, methods, and even a few secret sauces, remember: **you'll always need to adapt to your local ingredients**.



## Beyond Rigid Frameworks: IT Architecture as a Collaborative, Adaptable, Outcome-Oriented Practice

In this book, I use the terms **IT architecture** and **IT architects** broadly and inclusively. I do not draw strict lines between enterprise, solution, technical, or software architecture, nor do I narrowly define titles such as enterprise architect, solution architect, or staff-level technical leaders like principal engineers.

![](assets/images/istock/iStock-1376008059.jpg)
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/brightstars">brightstars</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

Instead, I view IT architecture as a **cohesive function**—a bridge that connects technology, business, product, and organizational strategy. Architecture encompasses more than a set of tasks or responsibilities; it serves as the **connective tissue** that brings coherence to complex ecosystems, enabling various parts of the organization to work in harmony.

### Grounding and Empowerment

Rather than advocating for rigid distinctions between roles, I propose **empowering architects with a data-informed, outcome-oriented mindset**. In this approach, architectural roles are **adaptable**, evolving to meet the organization’s needs while remaining aligned to deliver meaningful value.

**Grounded Architecture** refers to anchoring architectural work in the organization’s reality:

* Grounded in **data** to inform decisions
* Grounded in **people** to foster collaboration and shared understanding
* Grounded in **pragmatic operating models** that guide action

To adopt this approach, you do not need to restructure your teams or redefine every role. What matters most is **how architects operate**—as collaborators, connectors, and enablers of aligned outcomes.

### Adaptability Over Rigidity

IT architecture is **not one-size-fits-all**. Its form and focus should adapt to the context of each company. In some organizations, the emphasis may be on **business alignment**—ensuring that technology investments directly support the mission. In others, the focus may be on **technical depth**—working closely with engineers to build scalable, secure, high-performing systems.

Regardless of emphasis, the **core function remains the same**: to bring coherence to complexity and alignment to decisions. Therefore, I define “architect” not by job title, but by function—anyone who bridges the gap between **strategic intent and technical execution** is an architect.

This adaptable perspective allows organizations to maximize the benefits of architecture while enabling architects to adjust their contributions based on what is most needed—strategy, integration, governance, or mentorship.

### Accepting the Challenges

Of course, this broader and more flexible view brings **new challenges**.

Unlike traditional frameworks, which have predefined roles, clear handoffs, and rigid responsibilities, the Grounded Architecture approach **requires architects to adapt continuously**. It values relevance over formality and responsiveness over structure.

This approach **can be demanding**.

It requires architects to:

* Shift fluidly between **strategic thinking and hands-on guidance**
* Engage regularly with **diverse stakeholders**
* **Recalibrate their priorities** as business needs evolve
* Make decisions amid **ambiguity and uncertainty**

It also demands sound judgment—knowing **when to lead, when to advise, and when to step back**.

However, with these challenges come significant benefits.

Architects who embrace this approach are better equipped to respond to real-world needs. They help build solutions that are **context-aware**, **collaborative**, and **aligned with long-term goals**. They foster trust, promote innovation, and unlock value—not by controlling systems, but by guiding them with insight, empathy, and adaptability.

This book is a call to **reimagine architecture as a living, collaborative, and responsive practice**. One that moves beyond rigid frameworks and static organizational charts. One that values architectural success not in titles or artifacts, but in **outcomes, alignment, and impact**.

It may not always be the easiest path, but I believe it is the one most capable of delivering lasting value in complex, modern organizations.

## Key Influences

The **Grounded Architecture** approach is shaped not only by my experiences but also by the work and ideas of others who have inspired and informed my thinking.

### The Architecture Elevator — Gregor Hohpe

One of the most influential voices behind this work is **Gregor Hohpe** and his concept of the [**Architecture Elevator**](https://architectelevator.com/). Gregor provides a vivid illustration of the modern architect as someone who navigates between the **"penthouse," where strategy is developed**, and the **"engine room," where technology is built**.

His perspective of architects as enablers of alignment, friction reduction, and transformation strategy has been foundational to my practice of Grounded Architecture. Much of what I share in this book reflects the valuable lessons learned from **applying Gregor’s ideas in real organizational contexts**.

### Staff+ Engineering — Tanya Reilly & Will Larson

Another major influence has been the evolution of **Staff+ engineering roles**, which present a contemporary and practical view of technical leadership. Key texts such as:

* [**The Staff Engineer’s Path** by Tanya Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)
* [**Staff Engineer** by Will Larson](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/)

...offer a clear and relatable framework for understanding **what senior technical leadership entails outside of traditional management tracks**. These models have significantly shaped my thoughts on the responsibilities, mindset, and career development of modern architects.

Staff+ engineers and architects often encounter similar challenges—balancing long-term vision with day-to-day decisions, influencing without authority, and collaborating across boundaries. The overlap between these roles is considerable, and these resources have informed my perspective on **architectural maturity, influence, and impact**.

### Many More Sources

Grounded Architecture is built on **a broad foundation of books, frameworks, articles, and tools**—too numerous to list in one place. I have collected and curated many of these resources in the online [**Bookshelf appendix**](https://grounded-architecture.io/bookshelf), where you can explore what has influenced this work and perhaps find inspiration for your own journey.


## Why This Book?

This book serves as a way to **generalize and share years of experience** as a practicing architect and architecture leader. It originated from a need to **clarify my thinking**, **educate others**, and **create shareable resources** that can help individuals and organizations better understand and apply modern architectural practices.

<br>

![](assets/images/writing.png)
***Figure 2:** Writing helped me refine my thinking, evolve tools and principles, and share lessons learned.*


### Writing to Think

Writing forces clarity. As **Gregor Hohpe** once said, *“Every sentence you write frees up brain cells to learn new things.”* This was true for me as I began to shape my ideas into written form. Writing this book helped me:

* **Organize my thoughts**
* **Identify gaps** and contradictions in my approach
* **Enhance my frameworks and tools**
* Discover **new insights** through reflection


### Writing to Teach

Another motivation was **education**—specifically, educating architects and technical leaders within the organizations I’ve worked for. I found that well-written, accessible material helps:

* **Explain the “why” behind architecture**
* **Standardize terminology and mindset**
* **Create alignment** across teams and levels

As Gregor Hohpe also points out, writing has several distinct advantages over spoken communication:

* **It scales** — You don’t need to be present to reach your audience.
* **It’s faster** — People read 2–3 times faster than they can listen.
* **It’s searchable and reusable** — Readers can revisit it, quote it, and reference it.

In short, **written content makes architectural thinking more portable and enduring**—ideal for spreading modern ideas across large, distributed organizations.


### Writing to Share (and Learn More)

By documenting and refining my experiences, I hope to make this content **valuable for others**—whether they are facing similar challenges or are simply curious about evolving their architectural practice. I also look forward to:

* **Learning from others' feedback**
* **Comparing notes with peers**
* Continuing the conversation about **what modern IT architecture can become**

This book is not a final answer; it’s a **living reflection** of one practitioner’s journey. My hope is that it sparks new insights, invites discussion, and helps architects—and those who work with them—develop more grounded, human, and effective practices.

## A Part of the Bigger Picture: A Trilogy in Four Parts

## A Bit of Personal History

The ideas and practices presented in this book are based on **years of hands-on experience** across various roles, organizations, and industries. Each chapter of my career has contributed essential insights that form the foundation of the **Grounded Architecture** approach.

### AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta

Much of the work in this book stems from my current role as **Chief Architect at AVIV Group**, as well as my earlier positions as **Principal Architect at eBay Classifieds** and **Adevinta**. These experiences have enabled me to lead architectural practices in **large, complex, and rapidly evolving organizations**, skillfully balancing long-term strategy with everyday realities.

### Software Improvement Group (SIG)

In the earlier stages of my career, I was a **consultant and analyst** at the [**Software Improvement Group (SIG)**](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/), where I discovered the power of **data-informed decision-making**. This role taught me how to extract meaningful insights from systems and how invaluable these insights are for guiding architectural choices.

Building on that experience, I developed [**Sokrates**](https://sokrates.dev), an open-source tool designed to extract data from source code repositories to visualize **system complexity, team structures, and organizational dynamics**. This work significantly influenced the **[Lightweight Architectural Analytics](analytics)** pillar of the Grounded Architecture framework.


### Incision

My tenure as **CTO of [Incision](https://incision.care)**, a healthcare startup, provided a direct view of the challenges in **building and managing a technology organization** from scratch. It was an intense, insightful, and humbling journey that deepened my understanding of architecture at the intersection of **delivery, constraints, and leadership**.

### Research in Design and Systems Thinking

Before entering the industry, I worked as a **researcher** at the [**Dutch Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)**](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) and [**Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)**](https://www.tue.nl/en/). This academic background equipped me with skills in **rigorous data analysis, modeling, and research methods**.

One project from that period that significantly shaped my perspective was [**Design Instability**](https://design-instability.com/), a series of essays co-authored with **Erik Stolterman**. We explored the commonalities in **architectural practices across disciplines**, including classical design, UX design, and software engineering. This exploration helped me appreciate the **value of cross-disciplinary thinking**, a crucial skill for modern architects working at the intersection of technology, people, and business.

### Developer Roots

Finally, I greatly value my early experience as a **hands-on software developer**. It's important for architects to remain close to the code and to the developers who write it. This technical grounding has proven essential in all my subsequent roles.

Together, these experiences have shaped a practice that is **data-informed, people-oriented, and grounded in real-world complexity**. This book reflects those lessons—not as a theoretical model, but as a **practitioner's field guide** for building architecture that truly works: **inside real organizations, with real people, solving real problems**.

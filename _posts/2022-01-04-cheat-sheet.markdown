## Introduction

### [Context: Fast Moving Global Organizations](context)
> * To better understand any idea or solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which these ideas developed. 
> * The grounded architecture approach has developed in the context of global, loosely coupled organizations that are diverse, with non-linear growth dynamics, and under transformation pressures. 
> * More specifically, the work I present here reflects my experiences as a Chief or Principal Architect at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta.

### [Goals](goals)
> * I identified the following needs that an architecture function should support: Executing At Scale, Increasing the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning, Higher Adaptivity.

 
## Grounded Architecture Structure 

### [Data Pillar](data)

> * The architecture data pillar serves as a medium to create a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of technology landscapes of big organizations. 
> * The data pillar provides an architecture-centric view on data about a technology landscape based on source code analyses, public cloud billing reports, vibrancy reports, or incident tickets.
> * To facilitate creation of data pillars, I have been working on development open-source tools, such as [Sokrates](https://sokrates.dev), that can help obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories.


### [People Pillar](people)
> * Developing the architecture function requires having competent, empowered, and motivated architects. Any architecture function must carefully organize, empower,
    and leverage scarce architecture talent.
> * We should not take architectural talent for granted. Architects are bridging local business, product, 
    organizational, and technology issues. Architects are difficult to hire talent as they need not only 
    in-depth technical knowledge but also domain-specific and organizational knowledge.
> * In my work in the past few years, I was working by combining, in different forms, two teams of architects: a small 
    central architecture team and a cross-organizational distributed virtual team. 

### [Activities Platform](activities-platform)
> * The Architecture Activities Platform defines a set of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging data and people pillars to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.
> * Examples of activities include: supporting teams in their daily work; tracking tech debt, defining tech debt reduction programs; performing technical due diligence; standardization of processes and documentation; defining cloud, data, and platform strategies.

## Being Architect

### [Architects as Superglue](superglue)

> * Architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.
> * Architects need to be technically strong. But their unique strengths should stem from being able to relate, or glue, technical issues with business and broader issues.
> * Superglue architects should stand on three legs: Skills, Impact, Leadership.

### [Skills](skills)

> * A typical skillset of an architects includes: hard (technical) skills, soft (people & social) skills, and business skills.

### [Impact](impact)
> * Architects' work is evaluated based the impact they've had on the organization. 
> * Architects can make an impact via three pillars: Big-Picture Thinking, Execution, and Leveling-Up.

### [Leadership](leadership)
> * My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet's work and the Netflix's valued behaviors.
> * Marquet focused on leadership and organizational management, with a particular emphasis on the principles of Intent-Based Leadership.
> * Borrowing from Netflix's original values the following behavioral traits are crucial for architects are: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.

### [Architects' Career Paths](career)
> * Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background.
> * I usually envision three tracks of seniority progression: Senior Architect, Principal Architect, and Enterprise Architect. 
> * Hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure.  


## Doing Architecture

### [The Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](culture-map)
> * I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a very helpful tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from a broad array of different cultures and backgrounds.
> * Meyer’s model contains eight scales, each representing a key area, showing how cultures vary from extreme to extreme: Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling.

### [Managing Organizational Complexity: Six Simple Rules](six-simple-rules)
> * Six Simple Rules emphasis that in today’s complicated business environment, you need to setup organisational structures based on cooperation. 
> * To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating to utilize the organization's capabilities to cope with complex problems. 
> * This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture.

### [In the Eye of the Storm: Aligning Business, Product, Technology and Organization Strategies](storm)
> * I want architecture always to address one of the most challenging problems our organization faces: a tension between technology, product, organization, and business functions.
> * Architecture should ensure that conversations happen between the technical, product, organizational, and business functions. 

### [Flexible Governance: Mandates, Taxation, Nudge](governance)
> * Grounded Architecture supports governance models adaptable to organizations' complex and diverse needs. I see a technology governance model as a well-balanced hybrid of three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.
> * By governing with mandates and bans, I mean guiding people by explicitly defining what they should or should not do.
> * Governing with taxes is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to "pay" some form of taxes on used resources.
> * Nudging is a form of governing where we create subtle or indirect suggestion influencing someone's behavior or decision-making without forcing them or limiting their freedom of choice.

### [Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options](economics)
> * Architects are frequently asked about the (economic) value of architecture or technology investments.
> * Answering this question is a crucial skill for any senior architect. But it may be difficult to answer this seemingly harmless question concisely and convincingly to a non-technical audience.
> * Borrowing from existing literature, I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of architecture: the return on investment metaphor and the selling options metaphor.

> **IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:** Understand that business architecture is a shared, often invisible practice that helps organizations understand how they create value — even if no one formally owns or names it.
> 
> **KEY POINTS:**
> * Business architecture is a loosely defined, often invisible discipline that spans strategy, operations, design, and technology — making it hard to pin down or assign to a single owner.
> * There’s ongoing debate about whether it exists as a standalone function or if it's simply a set of shared perspectives and practices scattered across roles.
> * Different roles shape business architecture in different ways — from enterprise architects and COOs to service designers and heads of strategy — often without using the term.
> * Rather than centralizing ownership, the most effective approach could be shared stewardship, where multiple teams contribute to a common understanding of how the business works and changes.
> * Ultimately, business architecture may be less about definitions and more about creating clarity — helping organizations see the whole, make better decisions, and connect intent with execution.

When discussing **business strategy and architecture**, the term **"business architecture"** frequently arises. However, if you talk to different people about it, you'll soon discover that there is **no universally accepted definition**. Some view business architecture as a way to **connect strategy to operations**, while others think in terms of **capabilities and value streams**. Some associate it with **enterprise architecture**, while others link it to **service design** or **transformation**.

A common question that arises is: *"Does this even exist as a distinct discipline?"*

This is a valid inquiry. Unlike more established functions such as **software architecture** or **product management**, business architecture often **lacks clear job titles**, **dedicated teams**, or a **formal mandate**. In some organizations, business architecture is **well-defined**, while in others, it is **embedded within teams** and **not explicitly identified**.

To help clarify this discussion, here are a few reference points that often emerge:

> **Business Architecture Guild**: "A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives with tactical demands."
>
> **TOGAF**: "The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes at a high level."

Therefore, **business architecture** illustrates **what a business does** (its capabilities), **how it delivers value** (its value streams), and **how it is structured to operate** (its people, processes, and systems). While these definitions are useful, they are only **starting points**.

**Gregor Hohpe** captures this ambiguity well when he states, *"Every organization has a business architecture, even if they don't have business architects."* The necessary work is being done, but it may not be **recognized as "architecture"**, and it rarely fits neatly into a specific category.

This section explores **what business architecture could entail**, **why it is often difficult to define or claim ownership of**, and **who influences it**—whether intentionally or by default.


<br>
## Business Architecture as a Way of Seeing

Instead of defining **business architecture** as a fixed discipline, it may be more beneficial to ask: *What types of thinking and coordination does it facilitate? What problems does it aim to address?*

<img style="margin-top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" 
     src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1830042746.jpg">
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

Because one of the deeper questions underlying all definitions is: **Does business architecture exist independently, or is it merely a collection of perspectives** derived from **strategy**, **operations**, **technology**, and **design**?

In some organizations, business architecture is recognized as a **specific role** or **structured practice**. In others, it manifests as a **loose set of activities** across **transformation programs**, **architecture teams**, or **service design efforts**. Regardless of whether it exists *formally*, the **need it fulfills is significant**: **understanding how the business operates and how it must evolve**.

Some teams articulate this through **capability models**, while others use **service blueprints**, **value streams**, or **operating models**. Some may depict it in **workshops**, while others manage it through **planning spreadsheets**. The **tools and language may differ**, but the **underlying aim remains the same**: to provide **structure and clarity** around **how the business creates and delivers value**.

This might be what makes business architecture intriguing, despite its **elusive nature**: it does not **prescribe a single method of operation**; rather, it encourages a **more holistic perspective**.


<br>
## Why It's Hard to Own (And That Might Be Okay)

One of the most common questions regarding **business architecture** is: *“Who owns it?”* The most honest answer is: **“Well… kind of everyone, and kind of no one.”**

Business architecture exists at the **intersection of many disciplines**—**strategy**, **operations**, **technology**, and **design**—making it difficult to assign it to a **single function**. Attempting to confine it to one area often **misses its true purpose**. It’s not merely about **control or ownership**; it’s about developing **shared models** that enable **better decision-making**.

The challenge arises because different teams approach business architecture from **various perspectives**:

* **Strategy teams** tend to view it as a way to **connect goals to initiatives**.
* **Operations leaders** focus on **streamlining processes** and **scaling efficiently**.
* **Designers** often emphasize **customer experience** and **service value flows**.
* **Architects** examine how **systems and capabilities interconnect**.

**None of these perspectives are wrong.** The real challenge is **integrating them** into a **coherent, flexible understanding** of the business that isn’t confined to **one individual’s knowledge** or a **single team’s presentation**.


<br>
## Who Shapes Business Architecture?

Instead of asking **who owns business architecture**, it's often more insightful to ask:
**Who is already shaping it — knowingly or unknowingly?**

<img style="margin-top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover"

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

Here are some of the usual contributors:

### **Business Architecture Teams**

In larger or more mature organizations, **dedicated business architects**—typically in **strategy or transformation offices**—focus on **modeling capabilities**, **designing operating models**, and creating **alignment frameworks**.

### **Enterprise Architects**

In many organizations, **enterprise architects** also engage in the business architecture domain. They **bridge technology and business**, often using **capability mapping** to connect **solutions with outcomes**. While they may not *own* business architecture, they **carry much of its responsibility**.

### **COOs and Operational Leaders**

When business architecture is centered on **enhancing functionality**—**streamlining operations**, **improving service delivery**, and **building cross-functional capabilities**—**Chief Operating Officers (COOs)** or **operational leaders** often play a crucial role. They may not use the term *architecture*, but their **work embodies its principles**.

### **Strategy and Planning Functions**

The **Head of Strategy**, **Chief of Staff**, or **enterprise planning teams** frequently develop **perspectives on the business** that are inherently architectural, even if they don't label them as such. They focus on **themes**, **investments**, **future state visions**, and the **necessities for business evolution**.

### **Organizational Design and Human Resources Teams**

When the focus shifts to **structure, roles, capabilities**, and **team integration**, business architecture intersects with **organizational design**. These teams often **model the human and structural aspects** of architecture, sometimes **more effectively than anyone else**.

### **Department Leaders**

Each **business unit** possesses its own **mini-architecture**—formalized or not. **Department heads** define how their teams operate, what they need to achieve, and how they measure success. These **localized insights** are **valuable contributions** to the broader enterprise picture.

### **Design and Service Strategy**

**Designers**, particularly in **service or experience roles**, often create **maps illustrating how value flows** through the organization from the **user’s perspective**. These models address **critical business architecture concerns** such as **handoffs**, **pain points**, **silos**, and **dependencies**.



<br>
## **Business Architecture as a Shared Space**

Perhaps the best way to understand business architecture is not as a fixed function or framework, but as a **shared space**—one that welcomes **multiple perspectives** and requires **active coordination**.

<img style="margin-top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" 
  src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1505278419.jpg">

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

It’s less about **who owns the models** and more about:

* **Who contributes** to them?
* **Who uses them** to make better decisions?
* **Who ensures** they remain relevant as the business evolves?

When this shared space is nurtured—with the right **conversations**, **models**, and **governance**—business architecture can become a **powerful enabler** of **strategy**, **agility**, and **clarity**.

<br>
## **Final Thought**

If you’re an **IT or enterprise architect**, you may already be **contributing to business architecture**—whether you realize it or not. You are **modeling capabilities**, **aligning systems with business needs**, and **helping teams navigate complexity**.

You don’t need to **own business architecture** to **influence it**.
You just need to bring **curiosity**, **structure**, and **empathy**.

Perhaps that's ultimately what business architecture is about: **not having all the answers, but fostering a better shared understanding—together.**

## Questions to Consider

* *Where in your organization is business architecture happening — even if no one calls it that? Is it in strategy, enterprise architecture, ops, or somewhere unexpected?*

* *Do you think business architecture exists as a distinct discipline in your company — or is it embedded across functions?*

* *Who currently shapes the way your organization views capabilities, value, and structure? Is it formalized, or more implicit and ad hoc?*

* *Is there a shared understanding of how your business creates value? Or does each team have its own mental model?*

* *How often do strategy, operations, design, and technology teams align on how the business is structured?*

* *What artifacts (if any) guide your organization’s understanding of business architecture? Capability maps, journey maps, operating models, org charts… or none of the above?*

* *Do your technology architecture decisions reflect a clear view of business priorities and value delivery?*

* *What would it take for business architecture to become more intentional and collaborative in your organization?*

* *If you had to draw your organization’s business architecture today, where would you start — and who would you invite to help?*

* *How might shifting from “ownership” to “shared stewardship” change how your org approaches business architecture?*

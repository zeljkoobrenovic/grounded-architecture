In this section of the book, I will introduce the **Grounded Architecture** framework—my practical approach to establishing an effective and scalable architecture practice within complex organizations.

I chose the name *Grounded Architecture* intentionally. It highlights the need to **avoid creating an "ivory tower" architecture practice**—one that is disconnected from the daily realities of the business. In a [fast-moving, global, and diverse environment](context), such disconnection is not only inefficient but also dangerous.

The Grounded Architecture framework is designed as a **pragmatic and adaptive solution**. Its aim is to keep architecture deeply **rooted in the organization**, prioritizing **people's interactions** and **real-time data** over rigid processes and cumbersome tools. The goal is to **embed architecture across all levels and parts of the organization**, serving as an antidote to traditional, top-down approaches that often fail to make a meaningful impact.

<br>
The Grounded Architecture framework consists of three core elements (see Figure 1):

* **Lightweight Architectural Analytics (Data)**
* **Collaborative Networks (People)**
* **The Operating Model** *(which will be covered in a later section)*


<br>
**Lightweight Architectural Analytics**:

This part is a **system of tools and resources** that provides architects with a **real-time, curated view** of the organization’s technology landscape. It enables **data-informed decision-making** at every level.

For more information, refer to the [Lightweight Architectural Analytics section](analytics).

<br>
**Collaborative Networks**:

These networks **connect everyone involved in architecture throughout the organization**—from central teams to embedded architects and tech leads. They are essential for ensuring that architectural decisions are **relevant, actionable, and aligned** with actual needs.

See the [Collaborative Networks section](people) for more details.

<br>
**The Operating Model**:

The **[Operating Model](operating-model)** ties everything together. It introduces **structures, routines, and roles** that connect people, data, and decisions into a **cohesive, collaborative, and impact-driven practice**. We will explore this in a dedicated section later in the book.


Now that we have completed a high-level overview of the Grounded Architecture framework, let’s dive deeper into each of its elements and see how they come to life in practice.

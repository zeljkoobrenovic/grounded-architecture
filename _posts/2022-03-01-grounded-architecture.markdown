In this part, I will briefly introduce the Grounded Architecture framework. I chose the term "Grounded Architecture" to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is **avoid having an "ivory tower" an architecture practice** disconnected from the organization. This disconnection is a real danger in a [fast-moving, global, and diverse setting](context). 

The Grounded Architecture framework is designed to be a **practical solution.** It aims to be **deeply rooted** in the organization, prioritizing **people's interactions** and **data** over processes and tools. The goal is to connect an architecture practice to all parts and levels of the organization, serving as a practical antidote to the 'ivory tower' architecture. In this part of the ebook, I will delve into the framework's structure and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Grounded Architecture framework is an approach to setting organizational structures for an architecture practice, and it has three elements:

* Architectural Analytics,
* Collaborative Networks,
* The Operating Model.

***Figure 1:** The Grounded Architecture framework.*

*Architectural Analytics* is **a system of tools and resources** that enables architects to make **data-informed decisions** based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape. [Architectural Analytics section](analytics) provides more details.

*Collaborative Networks* **connect all the people** doing architecture across the organization. Thse networks are crucial to ensure that an architecture practice has any **tangible impact**. The [Collaborative Networks section](people) provides more details.

Lastly, the *Operating Model* defines **a set of processes and agreements** enabling architects to do everything that an architecture practice typically does, leveraging Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact. The [Operating Model section](operating-model) provides more details on the Operating Model.

I want to emphasize that, in my view, any operating model is only relevant if there are **healthy Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks**. Without data and people connections, an operating model leads to an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.

Grounded Architecture is particularly well-suited for organizations that are organized based on cooperation. Consequently, I use the **[Six Simple Rules](six-simple-rules)** framework as an essential guideline. As businesses grow increasingly complex, you cannot overstate the importance of cooperation within organizational structures. The "Six Simple Rules" framework emphasizes that successful organizations leverage their members' collective judgment and cooperation. By fostering a culture of collaboration, organizations can better utilize their capabilities to address and resolve complex problems. Grounded Architecture and Six Simple Rules are best friends. The Six Simple Rules ideas have been a significant source of inspiration for my work. This approach underscores the need for architects to build and support cooperative environments where teamwork and shared decision-making are paramount. Encouraging open communication, mutual respect, and shared goals can significantly enhance an organization's ability to navigate complexities and adapt to change. Conway's Law shows that the link between organizational structures and IT architecture is like peanut butter and jelly—strong and better together. The Six Simple Rules approach and architectural work involve managing complexity without getting tangled up.



Now that we've completed the high-level Grounded Architecture tour let's examine the specifics.

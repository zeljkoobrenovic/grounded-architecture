In this part, I will briefly introduce the Grounded Architecture framework. I chose the term "Grounded Architecture" to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is **avoid having an "ivory tower" architecture function** disconnected from the organization. This disconnection is a real danger in a [fast-moving, global, and diverse setting](context). In other words, I wanted to create an architectural function that is **well-grounded in the organization**.

Prioritizing **people's interactions and data** over processes and tools, Grounded Architecture aims to connect architecture practice to all organizational parts and levels as an antidote to the "ivory tower" architecture.

Grounded Architecture framework, as an approach to setting organizational structures for architectural practice, has three elements:

* Architectural Analytics,
* Collaborative Networks,
* The Operating Model.

***Figure 1:** The Grounded Architecture framework.*

*Architectural Analytics* is **a system of tools and resources** that enables architects to make **data-informed decisions** based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape. [Architectural Analytics section](analytics) provides more details.

*Collaborative Networks* is **a network of people** doing architecture across the organization. This Pillar is crucial to ensure that the architecture function has any **tangible impact**. The [Collaborative Networks section](people) provides more details.

Lastly, the *Operating Model* defines **a set of processes and agreements** enabling architects to do everything that architecture typically does, leveraging Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact. The [Operating Model section](operating-model) provides more details on the Operating Model.

The Operating Model is **only valid with the healthy Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks**. Without data and people connections, an Operating Model leads to an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.

Now that we’ve got the Grounded Architecture tour out of the way, let’s dig into the specifics.

In this part, I will briefly introduce the Grounded Architecture framework. I chose the term "Grounded Architecture" to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is **avoid having an "ivory tower" architecture practice** disconnected from the organization. This disconnection is a real danger in a [fast-moving, global, and diverse setting](context). 

The Grounded Architecture framework is designed to be a **practical solution.** It aims to be **deeply rooted** in the organization, prioritizing **people's interactions** and **data** over processes and tools. The goal is to connect the architecture practice to all parts and levels of the organization, serving as a practical antidote to the 'ivory tower' architecture. In this part of the ebook, I will delve into the framework's structure and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Grounded Architecture framework is an approach to setting organizational structures for architectural practice, and it has three elements:

* Architectural Analytics,
* Collaborative Networks,
* The Operating Model.

***Figure 1:** The Grounded Architecture framework.*

*Architectural Analytics* is **a system of tools and resources** that enables architects to make **data-informed decisions** based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape. [Architectural Analytics section](analytics) provides more details.

*Collaborative Networks* **connect all the people** doing architecture across the organization. Thse networks are crucial to ensure that the architecture practice has any **tangible impact**. The [Collaborative Networks section](people) provides more details.

Lastly, the *Operating Model* defines **a set of processes and agreements** enabling architects to do everything that architecture practice typically does, leveraging Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact. The [Operating Model section](operating-model) provides more details on the Operating Model.

I want to emphasize that, in my view, any operating model is only relevant if there are **healthy Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks**. Without data and people connections, an operating model leads to an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.

Now that we've completed the high-level Grounded Architecture tour let's examine the specifics.

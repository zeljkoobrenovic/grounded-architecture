In this part of the site, I describe the elements of Grounded Architecture. I chose the term "Grounded Architecture" to highlight that the primary goal of my approach was to avoid having an "ivory tower" architecture, disconnected from the organization, which is a fast-moving, global, and diverse setting that is a real danger. In other words, I wanted an architectural function that is well-grounded in the organization.

In the following sections, I will discuss three elements of Grounded Architecture:
* The Data Platform,
* The People Platform,
* The Strategy and Governance Platform.

The *Data Pillar* ensures that decisions architects can make data-informed decisions based on a real-time and complete overview of the state of the organization's technology. The [Data Pillar](data-pillar) section provides more details about this part.

The *People Platform* is another essential element of Grounded architecture. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, to transform an organization, you do not need to solve mathematical equations. A strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact. The [People Pillar](people-pillar) section provides more details about this part.

Lastly, the *Strategy and Governance Platform* does everything that architecture typically does, leveraging data and people platforms to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact. The [Technology Strategy and Governance](strategy-governance-platform) provides more details on Technology Strategy and Governance platform. While the Strategy and Governance platform by name looks most like a typical architecture function, I consider such a platform useless without the vital Data and People pillars. With data and better connections with key individuals, Strategy and Governance becomes a typical ivory tower, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.

# People, People, People

<div class="favorite-quote">
Architecture is <b>not so much about the software</b>, <b>but about the people</b> who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as <b>coupling and cohesion</b>, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; … But people do care about their coupling to other team members. <div class="author">-James O. Coplien</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Software design is <b>an exercise in human relationships</b>.
<div class="author">-Kent Beck</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Bad software architecture is a people problem. When <b>people don't work well together they make bad decisions</b>.
<div class="author">-Kate Matsudaira</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
To change the architecture of a software-intensive system ensconced in a large organization, you often have to change the architecture of the organization. And ultimately, that is <b>a political problem, not just a technical one</b>.
<div class="author">-Grady Booch</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
When driving change in an organization, one key metric is your <b>political capital bank account balance.</b> Calling out the emperor's new clothes, questioning the status quo, bringing change, all make withdrawals from your account. Make sure you deposit sufficiently: by keeping your word, delivering value, sharing your knowledge, or being transparent. There is no online banking site to check your account balance, so make sure to keep some reserve. At the same time, <b>political capital is meant to be spent!</b> Just don't overspend...

# Changing Role of Architecture

<div class="favorite-quote">

<div class="author">-Gregor Hohpe</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
The architect's role is changing from being primarily a decision maker to being a coordinator, advisor, and knowledge manager ... <b>a central knowledge hub</b>.
<div class="author">-Rainer Weinreich & Iris Groher</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Rather than inject itself in every decision loop, <b>architecture should design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions</b> - they’ll know better anyhow, and slowing them down carries a high cost..
<div class="author">-Gregor Hohpe</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Your architecture team’s job is to <b>solve your biggest problems</b>. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that.
<div class="author">-Gregor Hohpe</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Your organization has to <b>earn its way to an effective an architecture practice</b>. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems.
<div class="author">-Gregor Hophe</div>
</div>

# Complexity

<div class="favorite-quote">
Excessive complexity is nature’s punishment for <b>organizations that are unable to make decisions.</b>
<div class="author">-Gregor Hohpe</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
<b>Metawork is more interesting than work</b>. ... we love complicated little puzzles to solve, so we keep overengineering everything.
<div class="author">-Neal Ford</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Developers are <b>drawn to complexity like moths to a flame</b> often with the same result.
<div class="author">-Neal Ford</div>
</div>

<div class="favorite-quote">
Any time a company is in trouble, you’ll have people competing for power. Many of those people will swear up and down that the problem is simple and that they have the answer. Lesson: If you advocate for a more <b>inclusive, complexity-informed approach,</b> you’ll face people with influence (and likely past successes) actively <b>working to undermine you.</b>

Architecture is just a collective hunch, a <b>shared hallucination</b>, an assertion by a set of stakeholders on the nature of their observable world, be it a world that is or a world as they wish it to be.
<div class="author">-Grady Booch</div>
</div>
 
<div class="favorite-quote">
<b>Architects code</b>, but not to deliver code. Rather, to understand the ramifications of the decisions that they're making.

</div>

Architectural decisions are design decisions that are <b>hard to make</b> or <b>costly to change</b>.

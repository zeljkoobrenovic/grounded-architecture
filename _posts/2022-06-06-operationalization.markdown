> Operationalization is the creation of measurable proxies for rigorously investigating fuzzy concepts.

> I mean it the same way Wikipedia means it: “In research design, operationalization is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable, though its existence is indicated by other phenomena. It is the process of defining a fuzzy concept so as to make the theoretical concept clearly distinguishable or measurable, and to understand it in terms of empirical observations.”

Key principles:
* Arguing about Metrics Is a Waste of Time
* Define your metric before you name it.
* Name

If you remember that the name is merely a placeholder, you’ll be less likely to do something stupid like:

* Argue with tech bros (of all genders) about whether the metric really is measuring tech debt or software quality. It isn’t. That argument is as nonsensical as whether I’m allowed to call my variable X if you’ve already called yours X. As long as we both write what we mean at the top of our pages, we’re good, bro.
* Misinterpret an increase in “happiness” to mean something good is going on with your website. Perhaps the users can’t find what they’re looking for and they’re spending more time on the page while howling in frustration. If you remember what you’re actually measuring and that its name is just shorthand, you’ll be much safer.
* Assume someone else’s research about “tech debt” applies to your own scenario. Chances are that they defined their metric differently.
* Being careful with language and taking stock of our fuzziness with careful operationalization-based thinking is helpful not just for statistical inference but also for data collection and practical machine learning.

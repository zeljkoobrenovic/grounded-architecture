### Key Concepts from the Book

The book underscores the paramount importance of **knowing your audience**. This understanding, which includes their interests, concerns, and motivations, is the bedrock of effective communication. It also emphasizes the necessity of focusing on **the "So What?" factor,** urging communicators always to clarify their messages' relevance and why the audience should care. **Clarity and brevity** are also essential—you should deliver messages straightforwardly, avoiding jargon and complex terms.

Another critical point is keeping the **audience engaged**; interactive communication helps maintain interest and promotes better understanding. Finally, **preparation and practice** are essential; rehearsing your communication ensures clarity and builds confidence in your delivery.

The **use of stories and analogies** is recommended to make technical concepts more relatable and easier to understand. Mark Magnacca also provides practical tips on communicating different types of messages. He describes [various kinds of storylines](https://obren.io/tools/sowhat/) you can use to communicate almost any topic:

* **Action Jackson:** A simple storyline describing steps. Use it when you want to spell out an action plan. Build it to map overall recommendations and supporting steps. Avoid it when the audience still needs to be convinced.
* **The Pitch:** Articulates and supports a recommendation. Use it when you need to persuade someone. Highlight your value proposition 'right up front.' Avoid being glib; your supporting reasons must convince your audience.
* **Traffic Light:** Use it for status updates. It enables you to provide an overview and explain your current position in detail. Avoid being sloppy.
* **Close the Gap:** Use it to gain your audience's buy-in in one meeting. Explain where you are and where you need to get.
  Build it to outline the case for your action plan. Stick to storyline rules so your audience supports your action
  plan.
* **Houston, We Have a Problem:** Use when you need to convince an audience of a problem and talk them through actions.
  Great at combining diagnostics and action. Maps problems, the cause, and resulting steps. Avoid overkill; it is about convincing.
* **To B, or Not to B:** Use to take your audience on the journey through your thinking. It argues for one particular option. It enables you to explain first and then make recommendations last. Make sure it's complete - great when you need to work through all options, not just one option you like.
* **Watch Out:** This storyline persuades the audience of the need to change direction. It combines what's working, risks, and action in the same story. Maps what's succeeded, the risks, and remedies. Avoid crafting a narrative that flows without compelling logic.

The book also proposes a structured framework to communicate ideas clearly and persuasively. The framework suggests that each communication has three main parts:

* A short introductory narrative with three elements:
  1. **Context**: This sets the stage by providing the background information or the current situation. It helps the audience understand the environment or circumstances in which the issue or opportunity exists. Not everyone knows the situation as you do.
  2. **Trigger**: This specific event or observation prompts the need for discussion or action right now. It highlights what has changed or what new information has come to light that necessitates addressing the issue.
  3. **Question**: This is the pivotal "so what!" question that captures the main concern or the central issue that needs to be addressed.
* **One key point** that is a focus of your storyline. It should provide a clear and concise answer to the question from the introductory narrative.
* **Supporting points**: These support the proposed answer with data, examples, or logical reasoning. They provide the justification for the recommendation and help convince the audience of its validity.

This structure helps ensure that communication is clear, logical, and persuasive, making it easier for the audience to understand and buy into the proposed solutions.


### Examples

Here are a few examples of how you could use "So What!" techniques in IT practice:

#### Example 1: **Action Jackson**

**Scenario**: Implementing a new feature in a software application.

**Introductory Narrative:**
* Context: Our previous analysis has shown that we must enhance our user experience to stay competitive.
* Trigger: Feedback from our recent user survey indicates a high demand for a new feature, an opportunity to improve the overall user experience and add value via new functionality.
* Question: How do we implement this feature effectively? Can we accelerate the delivery?

**Key Point**: 
* We will prioritize this as a new initiative but not create shortcuts. We will follow our standard structured approach involving requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and post-deployment monitoring.

**Supporting Points**: 
* As this is a complex and risky feature, we must follow an existing disciplined process. 
* We will gather requirements by collaborating with stakeholders to define the feature, create design documents approved by the architecture team, implement the feature using our standard methodology, conduct thorough unit and integration testing, deploy the feature to production, and monitor its performance post-deployment. 
* This process ensures a successful feature launch with minimal risks.


#### Example 2: **The Pitch**

**Scenario**: Proposing a new tool for automated testing.

**Introductory Narrative:**
* **Context**: Our current testing process is time-consuming and prone to human error. We have previously evaluated several tools and identified Tool X as the best option for automation. At that point, we decided not to adopt it due to a lack of resources. 
* **Trigger**: Recent delays and errors in the last project highlighted the inefficiency of our manual testing, reopening requests to adopt an automation tool. However, adoption of the tool would require additional resources.
* **Question**: Why should we invest resources and adopt Tool X for automated testing?

**Key Point**: 
* Tool X is a cost-effective solution aligned with our technology platform that will increase efficiency, save costs, enhance accuracy, and scale with future growth.

**Supporting Points**: 
* Tool X reduces testing time by 50%, saves $100,000 annually, minimizes human error for more reliable results, and can quickly scale to accommodate future growth. 
* These benefits make Tool X a valuable addition to our testing toolkit.


#### Example 3: **Houston, We Have a Problem**

**Scenario**: Addressing a critical performance issue in the software.

**Introductory Narrative:**
* **Context**: We use a legacy database with known performance issues. Until recently, database performance was manageable and did not negatively affect user experiences.
* **Trigger**: Since this week, users have reported slow response times, impacting their experience.
* **Question**: How do we resolve this performance issue?

**Key Point**: 
* The performance issue is serious and will not disappear by itself. We need to take proactive steps to resolve it. We must thoroughly analyze, optimize queries, and likely reindex the database.

**Supporting Points**: 
* The performance issue is due to inefficient database query optimization. 
* We will diagnose the problem, pinpoint inefficient queries and indexing issues, implement optimizations, and continuously monitor performance to ensure improvement.


#### Example 4: **To B, or Not to B**

**Scenario**: Deciding between two software development frameworks.

**Introductory Narrative:**
* **Context**: We must select a framework for our next project.
* **Trigger**: The deadline for project start is next month.
* **Question**: Which framework should we choose?

**Key Point**: 
* After evaluating both, Framework A is the best choice.

**Supporting Points**: 
* Framework A offers high performance and extensive community support but has a steep learning curve and higher cost. Framework B is easier to use and cheaper but has limited scalability and a smaller community. 
* Based on our requirements and long-term goals, Framework A aligns better despite its higher cost.


#### Example 5: **Watch Out**

**Scenario**: Advising on potential risks in a software project.

**Introductory Narrative:**
* **Context**: Our project is progressing, but with some known manageable existing security risks.
* **Trigger**: The upcoming API integration opens significant new security risks.
* **Question**: How do we mitigate these new risks?

**Key Point**: 
* It's imperative that we implement additional security measures and conduct more thorough testing to address the seriousness of the situation.

**Supporting Points**: 
* Although our development process is efficient and on schedule, the API integration has the potential to disrupt this, introducing security risks that need immediate attention. 
* With our team's expertise, we can implement additional security measures and conduct thorough testing before integration, proactively addressing these risks and ensuring project success.
* Extra resources may be temporarily needed to avoid significant delays in the roadmap.

## Radical Candor

**"Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity"** by Kim Scott is an invaluable resource for IT and software architects who engage in critical conversations. The book provides a framework for giving and receiving feedback, building solid relationships, and fostering a culture of open communication. These principles can greatly enhance team dynamics, project efficiency, and overall job satisfaction.

<br>

</div>

### Key Concepts from the Book

Scott defines a feedback-providing communication framework as having two access points: the directness of challenge and the amount of personal caring. Based on this framework, she describes four quadrants, representing different styles of how people provide feedback:

- **Radical Candor**: Caring personally while challenging directly.
- **Ruinous Empathy**: Caring personally without challenging directly.
- **Obnoxious Aggression**: Challenging directly without caring personally.
- **Manipulative Insincerity**: Neither caring personally nor challenging directly.

<br>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friendly reminder. Contempt, arrogance, character attacks, and the like are not Radical Candor or valid forms of criticism...These are forms of Obnoxious Aggression. <a href="https://t.co/cdfSxJvr8z">pic.twitter.com/cdfSxJvr8z</a></p>&mdash; Kim Scott (@kimballscott) <a href="https://twitter.com/kimballscott/status/1410707132572266501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br>

Radical Candor is the only favorable option, which only happens when you:
1. **Care Personally**: Show genuine concern for your team members' well-being and career growth.
2. **Challenge Directly**: Provide honest, straightforward feedback to help team members improve.

"Radical Candor" offers a framework that IT architects can use to enhance their leadership and communication skills. By applying Scott's principles of caring personally and challenging directly, IT professionals can build stronger teams, foster a culture of continuous improvement, and drive successful project outcomes. The contrasting examples from other quadrants (Ruinous Empathy, Obnoxious Aggression, and Manipulative Insincerity) illustrate the importance of balancing care and directness to achieve the best results.


### Feedback Interactions

Radical Candor work also promotes the Center for Creative Leadership’s SBI Model is a powerful tool for providing structured and constructive feedback. It helps in delivering feedback in a clear, concise, and focused manner by breaking it down into three key components:

1. **Situation**: This involves describing the context or specific situation in which the behavior occurred. It sets the stage for the feedback by providing background information, which helps the receiver understand the circumstances surrounding the feedback.
   - Example: "During our team meeting last Friday..."

2. **Behavior**: This is about pinpointing the specific behavior observed. It focuses on what the person did or said without interpreting or judging the behavior.
   - Example: "...you interrupted several colleagues while they were speaking..."

3. **Impact**: This articulates the effect of the behavior on others, the team, or the project. It helps the receiver understand the consequences of their actions.
   - Example: "...which led to some team members feeling undervalued and disrupted the flow of the meeting."

For future reference, the Radical Candor authors have developed a derivative of the SBI model called the SWI Model, which is adapted to focus more on the work performed and its outcomes. It consists of:

1. **Situation**: This remains the same as in the SBI model. It involves describing the context or specific situation in which the work was performed.
   - Example: "During the development phase of the project last month..."

2. **Work**: This replaces the "Behavior" component with a focus on the specific work product, project, deliverable, or performance goal. It highlights what was done, achieved, or delivered.
   - Example: "...you developed a comprehensive report on market trends..."

3. **Impact**: As in the SBI model, this component articulates the impact of the work product or specific performance. It explains the effect or outcome of the work.
   - Example: "...which provided valuable insights that helped shape our marketing strategy and increased team confidence in our approach."

By using the SWI model, feedback is tailored to emphasize the quality and impact of the work itself, making it particularly useful for performance reviews and project evaluations. Both models aim to provide clear, actionable feedback that helps individuals understand their strengths and areas for improvement, fostering a constructive and supportive feedback culture.


### Examples

Here are a few examples you could use to get inspiration onhow tu use Radical Candor in IT practice:

#### **Scenario 1**: Providing feedback on a poorly designed system architecture.

With Radical Candor, begin by acknowledging the hard work the team has put into the current design. "I appreciate the effort everyone has invested in this project. However, I've noticed some scalability concerns that we need to address. Let's look at how we can refactor the design to handle increased load better." In contrast, Ruinous Empathy might sound like, "Great job on the design, everyone. Let's not worry too much about scalability issues right now; we'll figure it out later." Obnoxious Aggression would be, "This design is terrible. How could you miss these scalability issues? We need to fix this immediately." Manipulative Insincerity would come across as "I guess the design is okay, but there
might be some minor scalability issues. Do whatever you think is best."

#### **Scenario 2**: Addressing technical debt and its impact on future projects.

Using Radical Candor, you could say, "I know everyone has been working tirelessly to meet our deadlines. We need to allocate time to reduce our technical debt. It will hinder our future development and slow us down if we don't address it now." On the other hand, Ruinous Empathy might be, "You all have worked so hard; let's not worry about technical debt right now. We can deal with it later." Obnoxious Aggression would sound like, "The technical debt is getting out of control. This is unacceptable, and we need to fix it now." With Manipulative Insincerity, you might say, "There might be
some technical debt, but it's not a big deal. Just keep doing what you're doing."

#### **Scenario 3**: Managing unrealistic project expectations from upper management.

Using Radical Candor, you might say, "I know there's a lot of pressure to deliver quickly in a competitive market. However, the current expectations are unrealistic given our resources. We must discuss what can be realistically achieved within the given timeframe and how we can adjust our approach." Ruinous Empathy would be, "We'll try our best to meet the deadlines, we understand the importance of the project." Obnoxious Aggression could be, "These expectations are completely unrealistic and unachievable. We can't do it." Manipulative Insincerity might be, "Sure, we'll meet the deadlines, I am confident we will find a way."

## Never Split the Difference

**"Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It"** by Chris Voss is an essential read for IT and software architects who frequently face challenging conversations and negotiations—drawing from his experience as an FBI hostage negotiator, Voss shares effective techniques and strategies that you can apply directly to IT architecture and software architecture discussions, ensuring better outcomes without compromising on critical objectives.

"Never Split the Difference" means not compromising or settling for less than what you want in a negotiation. Instead of agreeing to a middle-ground solution where both parties give up something, Voss advocates using strategic and psychological techniques to achieve a more favorable outcome. The idea is to aim for the best possible deal rather than a mediocre one that leaves both sides partially dissatisfied. For instance, the teams can agree to work on two projects to avoid blame and tense discussion even if they know they lack capacity and the planning is too optimistic. They then fail both projects. Alternatively, they should reject or postpone one project and commit to delivering only one with a lower risk of failure.

</div>

### Key Concepts from the Book

The books apply several vital concepts and techniques you can use under challenging negotiations:

1. **Tactical Empathy**: Understanding and actively listening to the counterpart's perspective to build rapport and trust.
2. **Mirroring**: Repeating the last few words the other person said to encourage them to elaborate.
3. **Labeling**: Identifying and acknowledging the other person's feelings to validate their emotions.
4. **Accusation Audit**: Preemptively addressing any negative assumptions the other party might have.
5. **Calibrated Questions**: Ask open-ended questions that begin with "What" or "How" to steer conversations and gather information. Avoid using "why" as it can sound accusatory. For instance, ***"How am I supposed to do that?"*** is a powerful, widely applicable, calibrated question designed to make the other party reconsider the feasibility of their demand and encourage a more realistic and collaborative discussion about what can be achieved.
6. **The Power of No**: Understanding that hearing "No" can be a pathway to uncovering the real issues and fostering a sense of control for the other party.

"Never Split the Difference" offers valuable techniques for IT and software architects to enhance their negotiation skills, enabling them to navigate difficult conversations and achieve favorable outcomes. By applying Voss's strategies, IT professionals can address concerns, build consensus, and drive successful implementation of critical architectural changes.


### Examples

Here are a few examples you could use to get inspiration on how to use described techniques in IT practice:

#### **Scenario 1**: Convincing stakeholders to adopt a new cloud architecture.

Use Tactical Empathy by understanding the concerns of stakeholders who may worry about data security or cost implications. You might say, "It sounds like you are concerned about the security of our data in the cloud." Employ Mirroring when a stakeholder says, "I'm worried about the cost," by responding, "The cost?" Utilize Labeling by saying, "It seems like you're feeling uncertain about the transition." Conduct an Accusation Audit with, "You might think this is going to be too expensive and risky, and I understand why you'd feel that way." Ask Calibrated Questions such as, "What are the main challenges you see with moving to the cloud?" or "How can we ensure our data remains secure?" Finally, use The Power of No: "Would it be a ridiculous idea to explore a hybrid model?"

#### **Scenario 2**: Negotiating deadlines with the product management team.

Show Tactical Empathy by understanding the pressure the product management team might be under to deliver on time: "It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure to meet these deadlines." Use Mirroring when a product manager says, "We need this feature by the end of the month," by responding, "By the end of the month?" When they say, "Yes, the marketing team has already planned a campaign around it," you might respond with, "Planned a campaign?" They might elaborate, "Yes, and if we miss the deadline, it will throw everything off." Follow up with, "Throw everything off?" leading to, "Yes, it will affect our quarterly targets." Label this by saying, "It seems like you're worried about how delays might affect the quarterly targets." Perform an Accusation Audit with, "You might think the engineering team is slow and unresponsive to deadlines." Use Calibrated Questions such as, "What can we do to ensure the most critical features are delivered on time?" or "How can we prioritize tasks to meet your needs without compromising quality?" Use The Power of No: "Would it be unreasonable to extend the deadline by two weeks to ensure the feature is fully tested?"

#### **Scenario 3**: Gaining team buy-in for adopting a new technology stack.

Show Tactical Empathy by understanding the team's hesitation towards learning and integrating new technologies: "It sounds like you're concerned about the learning curve associated with this new technology." Use Mirroring when a team member says, "I don't see the need for this change," by responding, "Don't see the need?" When they say, "Yes, our current stack is working fine for us," respond with, "Working fine for us?" When they add, "Yes, we're familiar with it, and it meets our needs," you could say, "Meets our needs?" leading to, "Yes, switching to something new would be a hassle." Label this by saying, "It sounds like you're worried about the hassle of switching to a new technology, and you feel the current stack meets our needs." Perform an Accusation Audit by stating, "You might think this new technology will be too complex and time-consuming to adopt." Use Calibrated Questions such as, "What are the main challenges you anticipate with adopting this new technology?" or "How can we support the team to make the transition smoother?" Use The Power of No: "Would it be a terrible idea to start with a small, non-critical project to evaluate the benefits of the new stack?"

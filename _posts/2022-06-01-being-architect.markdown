The following reflections provide some resources, ideas and key lessons I learned about what is means to be an architect in practice:

* **[Architects as Superglue](superglue)**: Architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.
* **[Skills](impact)**: A typical skillset of an architects includes: hard (technical) skills, soft (people & social) skills, and business skills.
* **[Impact](impact)**: Architects' work is evaluated based the impact they've had on the organization. They must demonstrate that they identify, tackle, and deliver on strategic problems, have a deep and/or broad influence, and deliver solutions that few others can.
* **[Leadership](behaviors)**: My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet’s work and the Netflix’s valued behaviors.
* **[Architects' Career Paths: Raising the Bar](career)**: Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background. Hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure.

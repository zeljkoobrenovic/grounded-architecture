> *”Architecture is not so much about the software, but about the people who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as coupling and cohesion, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; ... But people do care about their coupling to other team members.”* - James O. Coplien

One of the central premises of our work is that we should not take our architectural talent for granted. Architects are bridging local business, product, organizational, and technology issues. Architects are difficult to hire talent as, to operate correctly, they need in-depth technical knowledge and domain-specific and organizational knowledge.

The **People Pillar** is an essential element of Grounded Architecture. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, to transform an organization, you do not need to solve mathematical equations. You need to move people. Consequently, having a strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact.

In my work in past few years, I was working by combining, in different forms, two teams of architects: a small central architecture team, as well as a cross-organizational distributed virtual team. A central architecture team serves as an enabler for the rest of the organization, helping accelerate strategic transformations. A distributed virtual architecture team consists of architects (or other people making architecture decisions in their teams) working in local organizational units but spending some time (e.g. 10-20%) in a virtual team with peers from other teams. I found that such a distributed virtual architecture team is a crucial element of an architecture function, as it provides the connection (grounding) across the all parts and levels of the organization, increasing the visibility and connections, and making it easier to implement change across the organization. [This section](people) elaborates more on the distributed virtual architecture team.

## Central and/or Federated Architecture Function

The architecture function generally follows one of two fundamental models: central or federated.
 ([McKinsey 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/crafting-the-optimal-model-for-the-it-architecture-organization)).

The central model involves a large-scale central architecture team. The central team defines the process for approval of new work and assures adherence by development teams. In this model, development teams have few or no qualified solution architects that are typically a part of the central architecture team. In this model, centralized teams for infrastructure, operations, and security, are also held apart from the development function. Control and governance are typically the primary concerns of the central architecture team.

The federated model generally relies upon a guild or "community of practice" of solution architects embedded into individual development teams. A small central architecture team or an architecture center of excellence (CoE) may complement such a guild. The federated model's architects facilitate high-level planning and act as on-demand service providers for distributed teams.

The federated model is more commonly associated with cross-functional DevOps culture. The roles of solution and enterprise architects are generally broader in scope to integrate infrastructure, operations, and security concerns in product-oriented teams. The architect's role focuses on facilitation and enablement rather than control. The number of solution architects in a federated environment typically outnumbers the number of enterprise architects.

Today, modern agile organizations mainly adopt the federated model. This approach increases the likelihood that the central architecture team will spend its time closely involved with the challenges identified in the teams. The model ensures that the architects will be evaluated against the goals of the individual products they support, thereby focusing on improving performance and reducing complexity.


## The Hybrid Model

To operate in our complex context, we have invested effort to make sure that we have right people at the right places. We have opted for a hybrid organizational morning combining elements of Central and federated orientation structures. Consequently we have free key elements of our people dimension
* Central Architectural Teams (CATs), and
* Virtual Architectural Teams (VATs),
* A Chief Architect (CA)

## Central Architecture Team

In a central teams, we aimed at having a small number (less than 5) of people with droad experience, including hands on technical experiences. People who are well connected in the organization and externally, good communicators, and have a political acumen.

While the roles of people in central teams may differ, in general we aim at the following types of responsibilities:
* Identify, connect and maintain relationships with all relevant domain stakeholders
* Domain concept ownership: clarity, communication, resources
* Promotes data-informed domain decisions: identify, collect, use relevant data about the domain
* Influence all significant project in the domain (but no project management responsibilities)
* Internal community building around the domain
* External thought leadership
* Vendor relationships and roadmap alignment

## Virtual Architecture Team (VAT)

A virtual architectural team is composed of people that work full-time as architects or tech leads in specific organization or units but spending part time collaborating with architects from other units to reach more alignment, share knowledge, and leverage eachs other’s work.

Architects working in a VAT are always a part of some team, where they may be the only architects. But they can and should collaborate globally with architects in other units. In this peer-to-peer community, architects are collectively responsible for identifying and growing architectural talent, mentoring, and helping each other. 

A VAT can transform individual experiences into collective knowledge that can benefit the whole organization.

We have organised architects in several sub-teams:
* General teams, for a broader set of architectural topics. 
* Specialist teams focus on a particular part of technology stack. Examples include native mobile apps, web frontends, public cloud infrastructure, and so forth. 
* Strategic initiatives teams. For instance, data strategy, public cloud strategy, transcations or verticalization.

In general all teams followed similar pattern of rituals:
* regular (e.g., bi-weekly) forums, with updates, announcement of architectural spikes, and sharing or architectural decisions)
* annual or bi-annual summit, with several days of intensive knowledge sharing and workshops
* ad-hoc workshops, focusing on some clear topic

Pros:

Cons:

> *“A lot of cheap seats in the arena are filled with people who never venture onto the floor. They just hurl mean-spirited criticisms and put-downs from a safe distance. ... we need to be selective about the feedback we let into our lives. For me, if you’re not in the arena getting your ass kicked, I’m not interested in your feedback.”* — Brené Brown, Rising Strong

While we have provided some basic support, we found it critical that all communities take initiative and engage as much as possible people during these events. We wanted to prevent people just being passive receivers of information, but to actively engage.


## Chief Architect

Lastly, our model has a role of chief architect. The Chief Architect has two main areas of responsibilities:
* to make other architect work well. Rather than inject itself in every decision loop, architecture should design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions - they'll know better anyhow, and slowing them down carries a high cost. In this context, CA is a Curator, Role-model, and Catalyst
* working on the most important strategic initiatives: strategix, M&As

## Tips

While each organization will need it own approach, here are some tips I found useful in my approach to forming architecture teams or "people platform":
* Before making grandiose plans for reorganizations, make sure to connect with the people already doing some architectural work in an organization have, creating a community of practices or a virtual team. In this stage it is important to be inclusive, connect all key tech leaders, regarding of their actual position and title. In any form of organizations it will be crucial to be well-connected to these people, so this effort is never wasted. If creating a virtual team is a part of your architecture strategy, make sure to move away from creating a informal community of practice towards creating a team, with more accountability and responsibility. I found it useful to get a by in from key stakeholders, e.g. CTOs who should want to get their people work together with other architects.
* In early stages also connect with as many as possible non-architecture stakeholders. Again, in any form of organizations it will be crucial to be well-connected to these stakeholders, so this effort is never wasted.
* Align on the shared "superglue" vision and other operating principles with all stakeholders.
* Build and grow central team or change reporting lines carefully, and with close collaboration with engineering managers and CTOs. 
* Avoid hiring [digital hitman](https://architectelevator.com/transformation/dont-hire-hitman/). Grow internal candidate if possible. Architect require knowledge of technology, domain and organization. Finding such a person externally may be very difficult.
* Externalize. Reach out and connect. Participate in external events. Publish. Being strong externally can help you internally, especially in highly political settings.

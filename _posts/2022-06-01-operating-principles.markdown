The previous part described the structure and ideas of Grounded Architecture. But thoughts are not enough. They need to be implemented and embedded in daily work in the organization. I have identified the following operating principles that can help put these ideas into practice and get things done:

* [Strengthening Architectural Muscle Across Organization](muscle), and
* [Embracing Diversity, Distributing Decision-Making](diversity).

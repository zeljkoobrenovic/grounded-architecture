The previous part described the structure and ideas of Grounded Architecture. But thoughts are not enough. They need to be implemented and embedded in daily work in the organization. I have identified the following operating principles that can help put these ideas into practice and get things done:
* [Architects as Superglue](superglue),
* [Breaking Up Ivory Towers](ivory-towers),
* [Embrace Diversity, Distribute & Align Decisions](diversity),
* [Flexible Governance](governance).

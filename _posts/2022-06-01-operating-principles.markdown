excerpt: "I have identified the following operating principles that can help put the ideas of Grounded Architecture into practice and get things done: Developing Architects as Superglue, Being in the Eye of the Storm, Embracing Diversity, Distribute & Align Decisions, Having Flexible Governance, Applying Economic Modeling, Curisity, Doubt, Vision, Scepticism: Architect’s Personal Compass, and Culture Map: Architects’ Culture Mindfield Compass."

The following guiding principles have helped me make grounded architecture more effective:

* [Developing Architects as Superglue](superglue),
* [Being in the Eye of the Storm](storm),
* [Embracing Diversity, Distribute & Align Decisions](diversity),
* [Having Flexible Governance](flexible-governance),
* [Applying Economic Modeling](economics),
* [Curisity, Doubt, Vision, Scepticism: Architect's Personal Compass](compass), and
* [Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](culture).

With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and breakthroughs like ChatGPT, it is essential to reflect on how IT architecture as a discipline will develop in response to these emerging technologies.

As I anticipate the future of IT architecture, I envision teams actively engaging in the field of data science powered decision intelligence. Embracing data-driven insights and collaborative decision-making processes, IT professionals will join forces to optimize infrastructure choices and fuel innovation. This dynamic collaboration will foster improved communication, expertise sharing, and ultimately pave the way for highly effective solutions in businesses and organizations. The future of IT architecture is set to be an active and exciting journey!

 In the more AI driven era, decision intelligence is vital in addressing the challenges associated with AI adoption and deployment. As AI systems become more complex and powerful, it is increasingly essential for architects to have a strong understanding of how to design and manage AI projects responsibly. Decision intelligence equips architects with the necessary skills to create well-defined objectives, metrics, and safeguards for AI applications, ensuring they are ethical, transparent, and aligned with organizational goals. By fostering responsible AI practices, decision intelligence helps maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing potential risks and unintended consequences.

As artificial intelligence and machine learning become increasingly prevalent, IT architecture is poised to undergo significant transformation. LLMs and platforms like ChatGPT have the potential to streamline communication and collaboration among IT architects, engineers, and other professionals involved in the planning and execution of IT projects. By leveraging natural language processing capabilities, these technologies can facilitate better understanding of complex IT concepts, provide context-aware suggestions, and offer valuable insights for decision-making. AI-driven tools can aid in the design process of IT architectures, enabling professionals to create more efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions. Through iterative processes and generative algorithms, LLMs can assist in developing optimized IT infrastructures that consider factors such as security, performance, and cost-effectiveness, while adhering to specific requirements and constraints. The integration of LLMs and ChatGPT-like platforms can contribute to the development of intelligent IT systems and services. By harnessing the power of data analytics, these tools can help IT architects make better-informed decisions, leading to adaptive and resilient IT architectures that can handle the ever-growing demands of the digital world.

White the hype around AI is trong, it is important to rember that AI is a tools, and we need a framwerok to defing how to use it for our work. I found the area of decision intelligence ot be a good direction for development of my view of architecture. And AI is not always the best tool.

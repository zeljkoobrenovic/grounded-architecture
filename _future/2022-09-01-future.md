With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and breakthroughs like ChatGPT, it is essential to reflect on how IT architecture as a discipline will develop in response to these emerging technologies. In this part of my playbook, I look at the future and discuss my expectation of the further development of IT architecture field.

As artificial intelligence and machine learning become increasingly prevalent, IT architecture is poised to transform significantly. LLMs and platforms like ChatGPT have the potential to streamline communication and collaboration among IT architects, engineers, and other professionals involved in the planning and execution of IT projects. By leveraging natural language processing capabilities, these technologies can facilitate a better understanding of complex IT concepts, provide context-aware suggestions, and offer valuable insights for decision-making. AI-driven tools can aid in the design process of IT architectures, enabling professionals to create more efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions. Through iterative methods and generative algorithms, LLMs can assist in developing optimized IT infrastructures that consider security, performance, and cost-effectiveness while adhering to specific requirements and constraints. Integrating LLMs and ChatGPT-like platforms can contribute to developing intelligent IT systems and services. By harnessing the power of data analytics, these tools can help IT architects make better-informed decisions, leading to adaptive and resilient IT architectures that can handle the ever-growing demands of the digital world.

While the hype around AI is intense, it is essential to remember that AI is a tool, and we need a framework to define how to use it for our work. The area of decision intelligence is a good direction for the development of my view of architecture. And AI is only sometimes the best tool.

excerpt: "Decision intelligence is about giving yourself the skills and tools to turn information (whether it’s your memories of lunch conversations or it’s your foray through a massive database) into better actions (decisions!) at any scale (from tapas bites to petabytes) and in any setting"

The work of Cassie Kozyrkov inspires my view of decision intelligence. In her articles, Cassie Kozyrkov explores the concept of decision intelligence as an emerging academic discipline that aims to encompass various aspects of decision-making. It combines data science, social science, and managerial science to enable people to harness data to enhance their lives, businesses, and the world. As a crucial science for the AI era, it addresses the skills required to responsibly manage AI projects and design objectives, metrics, and safety measures for large-scale automation.

In the more AI driven era, decision intelligence is vital in addressing the challenges associated with AI adoption and deployment. As AI systems become more complex and powerful, it is increasingly essential for architects to have a strong understanding of how to design and manage AI projects responsibly. Decision intelligence equips architects with the necessary skills to create well-defined objectives, metrics, and safeguards for AI applications, ensuring they are ethical, transparent, and aligned with organizational goals. By fostering responsible AI practices, decision intelligence helps maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing potential risks and unintended consequences.

## Background 

Decision intelligence combines elements from applied data science, social science, and managerial sciences.

**Applied data science** focuses on extracting insights from data and applying those insights to real-world problems. Data scientists use machine learning, statistics, and data visualization techniques to analyze complex data sets, uncover patterns, and make predictions. By incorporating these techniques, decision intelligence can *help decision-makers better understand the data* and make more informed choices.

**Social science** is another critical element of decision intelligence. It deals with studying human behavior, society, and social relationships. By integrating concepts from psychology, sociology, and economics, decision intelligence considers the various factors influencing decision-making, such as cognitive biases, cultural norms, and individual motivations. This diversity of views allows for *a more comprehensive understanding of the decision-making process* and helps create more effective strategies for implementing data-driven solutions.

**Managerial science** contributes to decision intelligence by providing the tools and techniques necessary for effective organizational decision-making. These tools and techniques include operations research, management information systems, and organizational behavior. Managerial science helps decision-makers identify the most efficient and effective ways to allocate resources, set priorities, and implement change. In the context of decision intelligence, it *ensures that data-driven insights are translated into actionable strategies* that can be successfully applied in organizations.

## Key Concepts 

### Decision

Data are beautiful, but it’s decisions that are important. It’s through our decisions — our actions — that we affect the world around us.

We define the word “decision” to mean any selection between options by any entity, so the conversation is broader than MBA-style dilemmas (like whether to open a branch of your business in London).


### Decision Maker

In our parlance, a “decision-maker” is not that stakeholder or investor who swoops in to veto the machinations of the project team, but rather the person who is responsible for decision architecture and context framing. In other words, a creator of meticulously-phrased objectives as opposed to their destroyer.

### Decision Making

Decision-making is a word that is used differently by different disciplines, so it can refer to:

taking an action when there were alternative options (in this sense it’s possible to talk about decision-making by a computer or a lizard).
performing the function of a (human) decision-maker, part of which is taking responsibility for decisions. Even though a computer system can execute a decision, it will not be called a decision-maker because it does not bear responsibility for its outputs — that responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of the humans who created it.

### Calculation vs. Decision

Not all outputs/suggestions are decisions. In decision analysis terminology, a decision is only made once an irrevocable allocation of resources takes place. As long as you can change your mind for free, no decision has been made yet.

### Decision Sciences

The decision sciences concern themselves with questions like:

* “How should you set up decision criteria and design your metrics?” (All)
* “Is your chosen metric incentive-compatible?” (Economics)
* “What quality should you make this decision at and how much should you pay for perfect information?” (Decision analysis)
* “How do emotions, heuristics, and biases play into decision-making?” (Psychology)
* “How do biological factors like cortisol levels affect decision-making?” (Neuroeconomics)
* “How does changing the presentation of information influence choice behavior?” (Behavioral Economics)
* “How do you optimize your outcomes when making decisions in a group context?” (Experimental Game Theory)
* “How do you balance numerous constraints and multistage objectives in designing the decision context?” (Design)
* “Who will experience the consequences of the decision and how will various groups perceive that experience?” (UX Research)
* “Is the decision objective ethical?” (Philosophy)

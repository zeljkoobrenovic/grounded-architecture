excerpt: "Decision intelligence is about giving yourself the skills and tools to turn information (whether it’s your memories of lunch conversations or it’s your foray through a massive database) into better actions (decisions!) at any scale (from tapas bites to petabytes) and in any setting"

I expect that in coming years, IT architecture discipline will move closer to the field of data science, and more specifically decision intelligence. The work of Cassie Kozyrkov inspires my view of decision intelligence. In her articles, Cassie Kozyrkov explores the concept of decision intelligence as an emerging discipline that aims to encompass various aspects of decision-making. It combines data science, social science, and managerial science to enable people to harness data to enhance their lives, businesses, and the world. As a crucial science for the AI era, it addresses the skills required to responsibly manage AI projects and design objectives, metrics, and safety measures for large-scale automation.

Architecture is always related to decision-making. Like with my view on Grounded Architecture, basing these decsions in data is powerful tool. With new advances in data science and related disciplines, I expect that architectuer field will incresingly more rely on new tools and techniques.

In the more AI driven era, decision intelligence is vital in addressing the challenges associated with AI adoption and deployment. As AI systems become more complex and powerful, it is increasingly essential for architects to have a strong understanding of how to design and manage AI projects responsibly. Decision intelligence equips architects with the necessary skills to create well-defined objectives, metrics, and safeguards for AI applications, ensuring they are ethical, transparent, and aligned with organizational goals. By fostering responsible AI practices, decision intelligence helps maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing potential risks and unintended consequences.

In this secion I will introduce few key concepts from decision sciences.

## Background 

Decision intelligence is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements from applied data science, social science, and managerial science.

**Applied data science** emphasizes deriving insights from data and applying them to real-life challenges. Data scientists utilize machine learning, statistics, and data visualization to analyze complex data sets, identify patterns, and make predictions. By incorporating these techniques, decision intelligence can *assist decision-makers in better comprehending data* and making more informed decisions.

**Social science** plays a crucial role in decision intelligence, as it explores human behavior, societal dynamics, and social interactions. By incorporating ideas from psychology, sociology, and economics, decision intelligence takes into account various factors that influence decision-making, such as cognitive biases, cultural norms, and individual motivations. This diverse perspective allows for *a holistic understanding of the decision-making process* and facilitates the development of more effective, data-driven solutions.

**Managerial science** contributes to decision intelligence by offering tools and techniques for efficient organizational decision-making. These methods encompass operations research, management information systems, and organizational behavior. Managerial science aids decision-makers in determining the best ways to allocate resources, establish priorities, and execute change. Within the realm of decision intelligence, it *guarantees that data-driven insights are converted into practical strategies* that can be effectively implemented in organizations.

## Key Concepts 

### Decision

Data may be captivating, but it's the decisions that truly matter. Our choices and actions have a significant impact on the world surrounding us.

We interpret "decision" as any choice made among alternatives by any entity, broadening the scope beyond typical business-related conundrums (such as deciding whether to establish a branch of your company in London).


### Decision Maker

In decision intelligence terminology, a "decision-maker" is not an individual such as a stakeholder or investor who intervenes to override the project team's efforts. Instead, the decision-maker is someone accountable for establishing the decision framework and contextualizing the situation. This person is more of a strategist, carefully crafting well-defined objectives, rather than dismantling them.

### Decision Making

The term "decision-making" is interpreted differently across various fields, and can encompass:

1. Choosing an action from available alternatives, which can be applied to entities like computers or lizards.
2. Fulfilling the role of a human decision-maker, which entails taking responsibility for decisions. Although a computer system can carry out a decision, it is not deemed a decision-maker since it does not assume responsibility for its outcomes. This responsibility lies solely with the humans who developed the system.

### Decision Sciences

The decision sciences concern themselves with questions like:

* “How should you set up decision criteria and design your metrics?” (All)
* “Is your chosen metric incentive-compatible?” (Economics)
* “What quality should you make this decision at and how much should you pay for perfect information?” (Decision analysis)
* “How do emotions, heuristics, and biases play into decision-making?” (Psychology)
* “How do biological factors like cortisol levels affect decision-making?” (Neuroeconomics)
* “How does changing the presentation of information influence choice behavior?” (Behavioral Economics)
* “How do you optimize your outcomes when making decisions in a group context?” (Experimental Game Theory)
* “How do you balance numerous constraints and multistage objectives in designing the decision context?” (Design)
* “Who will experience the consequences of the decision and how will various groups perceive that experience?” (UX Research)
* “Is the decision objective ethical?” (Philosophy)

The following reflections provide some ideas and key lessons I learned about what is means to be an architect in practice:

* **[Architects as Superglue](superglue)**: I promote a view that architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.
* **[Architects' Behavioral Traits](behaviors)**: Netflix's overview of their valued behaviors is a good inspiration for coaching and developing architects. Borrowing from Netflix’s original values and reorganizing them from an architectural perspective, I consider the following behavioral traits to be crucial for architects: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.
* **[Making an Impact as an Architect](making-impact)**: Architects' work is evaluated based the impact they've had on the organization. They must demonstrate that they identify, tackle, and deliver on strategic problems, have a deep and/or broad influence, and deliver solutions that few others can.
* **[Architets' Career Paths: Raising the Bar](career)**: Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background. Hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure.

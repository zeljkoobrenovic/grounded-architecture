ðŸ”§ (Re)thinking IT Governance



In my experience, IT governance models blend three distinct governance styles, each with a unique role in shaping behavior and enabling alignment:



ðŸŽ¯ Nudging - Utilizing gentle, data-driven prompts such as default options or visual dashboards to guide choices without restricting freedom.



ðŸ’¸ Taxation - Implementing economic incentives that enhance visibility of resource usage and promote accountability (e.g., charging cloud costs to teams).



ðŸš« Mandates & Bans - Establishing clear, collaborative rules for critical areas like security and privacy, applied judiciously and purposefully.



This diversity is essential to upholding autonomy while ensuring strategic alignment and facilitating better decisions without imposing heavy-handed control.

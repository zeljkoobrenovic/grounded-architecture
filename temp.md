The Diversification Model features low integration and low standardization. Business units operate autonomously, catering to distinct markets or customer segments with minimal need to share data or processes.

While this model enables maximum flexibility and localized innovation, it often misses opportunities for synergies or cost savings. Business units remain independent by design, prioritizing autonomy to serve their unique markets or products (Figure 2). This model is ideal for holding companies or conglomerates, where operational overlap is limited and strategic focus varies across units.

The model promotes agility and innovation at the unit level, enabling rapid responses to market-specific demands. However, it presents challenges, including difficulty achieving economies of scale, limited cross-unit collaboration, and complexity when integration is later required.

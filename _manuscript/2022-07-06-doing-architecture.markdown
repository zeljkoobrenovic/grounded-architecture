A> **KEY POINTS:**
A> * I introduce ideas and key lessons I learned while developing ideas of Grounded Architecture in practice.

The following reflections provide some resources, ideas and key lessons I learned while developing ideas of Grounded Architecture in practice:

* **[The Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass](#culture-map)**: In multinational organizations, architects will need to work with many different cultures. I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a very helpful tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from a broad array of different cultures and backgrounds.
* **[Managing Organizational Complexity: Six Simple Rules](#six-simple-rules)**: Six Simple Rules emphasis that in today’s complicated business environment, you need to setup organisational structures based on cooperation. To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating to utilize the organization's capabilities to cope with complex problems. This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture.
* **[Product Development and The Build Trap](#product-development)**: Recognize bad product-development approaches. Recognize bad product manager archetypes. Know how a good product development process looks like.
* **[Architecture Governance: Mandates, Taxation, Nudge](#flexible-governance)**: I promote a technology governance model that combines three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.
* **[Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options](#economics)**: I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of technology investments and architecture: the return on investment metaphor, and the financial options metaphor.

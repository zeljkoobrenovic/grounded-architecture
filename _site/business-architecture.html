<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:</strong> Understand that business architecture is a shared, often invisible practice that helps organizations understand how they create value — even if no one formally owns or names it.</p>

  <p><strong>KEY POINTS:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Business architecture is a loosely defined, often invisible discipline that spans strategy, operations, design, and technology — making it hard to pin down or assign to a single owner.</li>
    <li>There’s ongoing debate about whether it exists as a standalone function or if it’s simply a set of shared perspectives and practices scattered across roles.</li>
    <li>Different roles shape business architecture in different ways — from enterprise architects and COOs to service designers and heads of strategy — often without using the term.</li>
    <li>Rather than centralizing ownership, the most effective approach could be shared stewardship, where multiple teams contribute to a common understanding of how the business works and changes.</li>
    <li>Ultimately, business architecture may be less about definitions and more about creating clarity — helping organizations see the whole, make better decisions, and connect intent with execution.</li>
  </ul>

<p><br />
When discussing <strong>business strategy and architecture</strong>, the term <strong>“business architecture”</strong> frequently arises. However, if you talk to different people about it, you’ll soon discover that there is <strong>no universally accepted definition</strong>. Some view business architecture as a way to <strong>connect strategy to operations</strong>, while others think in terms of <strong>capabilities and value streams</strong>. Some associate it with <strong>enterprise architecture</strong>, while others link it to <strong>service design</strong> or <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>

<p>A common question that arises is: <em>“Does this even exist as a distinct discipline?”</em></p>

<p>This is a valid inquiry. Unlike more established functions such as <strong>software architecture</strong> or <strong>product management</strong>, business architecture often <strong>lacks clear job titles</strong>, <strong>dedicated teams</strong>, or a <strong>formal mandate</strong>. In some organizations, business architecture is <strong>well-defined</strong>, while in others, it is <strong>embedded within teams</strong> and <strong>not explicitly identified</strong>.</p>

<p>To help clarify this discussion, here are a few reference points that often emerge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Business Architecture Guild</strong>: “A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives with tactical demands.”</p>

  <p><strong>TOGAF</strong>: “The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes at a high level.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, <strong>business architecture</strong> illustrates <strong>what a business does</strong> (its capabilities), <strong>how it delivers value</strong> (its value streams), and <strong>how it is structured to operate</strong> (its people, processes, and systems). While these definitions are useful, they are only <strong>starting points</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Gregor Hohpe</strong> captures this ambiguity well when he states, <em>“Every organization has a business architecture, even if they don’t have business architects.”</em> The necessary work is being done, but it may not be <strong>recognized as “architecture”</strong>, and it rarely fits neatly into a specific category.</p>

<p>This section explores <strong>what business architecture could entail</strong>, <strong>why it is often difficult to define or claim ownership of</strong>, and <strong>who influences it</strong>—whether intentionally or by default.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="business-architecture-as-a-way-of-seeing">Business Architecture as a Way of Seeing</h2>

<p>Instead of defining <strong>business architecture</strong> as a fixed discipline, it may be more beneficial to ask: <em>What types of thinking and coordination does it facilitate? What problems does it aim to address?</em></p>

<p><img style="margin-top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1830042746.jpg" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Because one of the deeper questions underlying all definitions is: <strong>Does business architecture exist independently, or is it merely a collection of perspectives</strong> derived from <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>operations</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, and <strong>design</strong>?</p>

<p>In some organizations, business architecture is recognized as a <strong>specific role</strong> or <strong>structured practice</strong>. In others, it manifests as a <strong>loose set of activities</strong> across <strong>transformation programs</strong>, <strong>architecture teams</strong>, or <strong>service design efforts</strong>. Regardless of whether it exists <em>formally</em>, the <strong>need it fulfills is significant</strong>: <strong>understanding how the business operates and how it must evolve</strong>.</p>

<p>Some teams articulate this through <strong>capability models</strong>, while others use <strong>service blueprints</strong>, <strong>value streams</strong>, or <strong>operating models</strong>. Some may depict it in <strong>workshops</strong>, while others manage it through <strong>planning spreadsheets</strong>. The <strong>tools and language may differ</strong>, but the <strong>underlying aim remains the same</strong>: to provide <strong>structure and clarity</strong> around <strong>how the business creates and delivers value</strong>.</p>

<p>This might be what makes business architecture intriguing, despite its <strong>elusive nature</strong>: it does not <strong>prescribe a single method of operation</strong>; rather, it encourages a <strong>more holistic perspective</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="why-its-hard-to-own-and-that-might-be-okay">Why It’s Hard to Own (And That Might Be Okay)</h2>

<p>One of the most common questions regarding <strong>business architecture</strong> is: <em>“Who owns it?”</em> The most honest answer is: <strong>“Well… kind of everyone, and kind of no one.”</strong></p>

<p>Business architecture exists at the <strong>intersection of many disciplines</strong>—<strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>operations</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, and <strong>design</strong>—making it difficult to assign it to a <strong>single function</strong>. Attempting to confine it to one area often <strong>misses its true purpose</strong>. It’s not merely about <strong>control or ownership</strong>; it’s about developing <strong>shared models</strong> that enable <strong>better decision-making</strong>.</p>

<p>The challenge arises because different teams approach business architecture from <strong>various perspectives</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strategy teams</strong> tend to view it as a way to <strong>connect goals to initiatives</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Operations leaders</strong> focus on <strong>streamlining processes</strong> and <strong>scaling efficiently</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Designers</strong> often emphasize <strong>customer experience</strong> and <strong>service value flows</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Architects</strong> examine how <strong>systems and capabilities interconnect</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>None of these perspectives are wrong.</strong> The real challenge is <strong>integrating them</strong> into a <strong>coherent, flexible understanding</strong> of the business that isn’t confined to <strong>one individual’s knowledge</strong> or a <strong>single team’s presentation</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="who-shapes-business-architecture">Who Shapes Business Architecture?</h2>

<p>Instead of asking <strong>who owns business architecture</strong>, it’s often more insightful to ask:
<strong>Who is already shaping it — knowingly or unknowingly?</strong></p>

<p><img style="margin-top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" src="assets/images/istock/iStock-904479942.jpg" /></p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Here are some of the usual contributors:</p>

<h3 id="business-architecture-teams"><strong>Business Architecture Teams</strong></h3>

<p>In larger or more mature organizations, <strong>dedicated business architects</strong>—typically in <strong>strategy or transformation offices</strong>—focus on <strong>modeling capabilities</strong>, <strong>designing operating models</strong>, and creating <strong>alignment frameworks</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="enterprise-architects"><strong>Enterprise Architects</strong></h3>

<p>In many organizations, <strong>enterprise architects</strong> also engage in the business architecture domain. They <strong>bridge technology and business</strong>, often using <strong>capability mapping</strong> to connect <strong>solutions with outcomes</strong>. While they may not <em>own</em> business architecture, they <strong>carry much of its responsibility</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="coos-and-operational-leaders"><strong>COOs and Operational Leaders</strong></h3>

<p>When business architecture is centered on <strong>enhancing functionality</strong>—<strong>streamlining operations</strong>, <strong>improving service delivery</strong>, and <strong>building cross-functional capabilities</strong>—<strong>Chief Operating Officers (COOs)</strong> or <strong>operational leaders</strong> often play a crucial role. They may not use the term <em>architecture</em>, but their <strong>work embodies its principles</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="strategy-and-planning-functions"><strong>Strategy and Planning Functions</strong></h3>

<p>The <strong>Head of Strategy</strong>, <strong>Chief of Staff</strong>, or <strong>enterprise planning teams</strong> frequently develop <strong>perspectives on the business</strong> that are inherently architectural, even if they don’t label them as such. They focus on <strong>themes</strong>, <strong>investments</strong>, <strong>future state visions</strong>, and the <strong>necessities for business evolution</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="organizational-design-and-human-resources-teams"><strong>Organizational Design and Human Resources Teams</strong></h3>

<p>When the focus shifts to <strong>structure, roles, capabilities</strong>, and <strong>team integration</strong>, business architecture intersects with <strong>organizational design</strong>. These teams often <strong>model the human and structural aspects</strong> of architecture, sometimes <strong>more effectively than anyone else</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="department-leaders"><strong>Department Leaders</strong></h3>

<p>Each <strong>business unit</strong> possesses its own <strong>mini-architecture</strong>—formalized or not. <strong>Department heads</strong> define how their teams operate, what they need to achieve, and how they measure success. These <strong>localized insights</strong> are <strong>valuable contributions</strong> to the broader enterprise picture.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-service-strategy"><strong>Design and Service Strategy</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Designers</strong>, particularly in <strong>service or experience roles</strong>, often create <strong>maps illustrating how value flows</strong> through the organization from the <strong>user’s perspective</strong>. These models address <strong>critical business architecture concerns</strong> such as <strong>handoffs</strong>, <strong>pain points</strong>, <strong>silos</strong>, and <strong>dependencies</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="business-architecture-as-a-shared-space"><strong>Business Architecture as a Shared Space</strong></h2>

<p>Perhaps the best way to understand business architecture is not as a fixed function or framework, but as a <strong>shared space</strong>—one that welcomes <strong>multiple perspectives</strong> and requires <strong>active coordination</strong>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1505278419.jpg" /></p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>It’s less about <strong>who owns the models</strong> and more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Who contributes</strong> to them?</li>
  <li><strong>Who uses them</strong> to make better decisions?</li>
  <li><strong>Who ensures</strong> they remain relevant as the business evolves?</li>
</ul>

<p>When this shared space is nurtured—with the right <strong>conversations</strong>, <strong>models</strong>, and <strong>governance</strong>—business architecture can become a <strong>powerful enabler</strong> of <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>agility</strong>, and <strong>clarity</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="final-thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong></h2>

<p>If you’re an <strong>IT or enterprise architect</strong>, you may already be <strong>contributing to business architecture</strong>—whether you realize it or not. You are <strong>modeling capabilities</strong>, <strong>aligning systems with business needs</strong>, and <strong>helping teams navigate complexity</strong>.</p>

<p>You don’t need to <strong>own business architecture</strong> to <strong>influence it</strong>.
You just need to bring <strong>curiosity</strong>, <strong>structure</strong>, and <strong>empathy</strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s ultimately what business architecture is about: <strong>not having all the answers, but fostering a better shared understanding—together.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Where in your organization is business architecture happening — even if no one calls it that? Is it in strategy, enterprise architecture, ops, or somewhere unexpected?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Do you think business architecture exists as a distinct discipline in your company — or is it embedded across functions?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Who currently shapes the way your organization views capabilities, value, and structure? Is it formalized, or more implicit and ad hoc?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is there a shared understanding of how your business creates value? Or does each team have its own mental model?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How often do strategy, operations, design, and technology teams align on how the business is structured?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What artifacts (if any) guide your organization’s understanding of business architecture? Capability maps, journey maps, operating models, org charts… or none of the above?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Do your technology architecture decisions reflect a clear view of business priorities and value delivery?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What would it take for business architecture to become more intentional and collaborative in your organization?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If you had to draw your organization’s business architecture today, where would you start — and who would you invite to help?</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How might shifting from “ownership” to “shared stewardship” change how your org approaches business architecture?</em></p>
  </li>

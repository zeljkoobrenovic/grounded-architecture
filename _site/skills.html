  <li>
    <p><strong>Project Management</strong>: Basic project management skills enable architects to oversee the implementation of their designs, ensuring projects are completed on time, within scope, and budget. Understanding project management methodologies can help architects work effectively with project managers and development teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Finance</strong>: Architects should understand basic financial principles, including budgeting, cost-benefit analysis, return on investment (ROI), and “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization” (EBITDA). This knowledge helps them make cost-effective decisions and justify the financial viability of proposed solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strategic Thinking</strong>: Architects need to think strategically and understand how their work supports the organization’s long-term goals. This thinking includes aligning technology initiatives with business strategy, identifying opportunities for innovation, and anticipating future business needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Change Management</strong>: Implementing new systems and architectures often involves significant organizational change. Architects should be familiar with change management principles to help facilitate smooth transitions, manage resistance, and successfully adopt new technologies and processes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By mastering these business skills, architects can ensure that their technical solutions are innovative, efficient, and aligned with their organizations’ broader business goals and strategies. This holistic approach enables architects to contribute more effectively to organizational success and drive meaningful business outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="decision-making-skills">Decision-Making Skills</h2>

<p>Architects’ work always requires pragmatic decision-making. Decisions are the steering wheel of organizations, and architects who are not involved in key decisions will have a limited impact on the organization.</p>

</div>

<p>Architects will have three roles concerning decision-making:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Be actual decision-makers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be advisors to decision-makers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Evaluate and provide feedback on the decisions of others</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Essential decision-making skills include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understanding that a decision is an irrevocable allocation of resources</strong>: This involves recognizing that every decision commits resources such as money, human effort, time, physical actions, and opportunities. Architects must consider the long-term implications of these allocations, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively to achieve organizational goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Know the basics of <a href="decision-intelligence">decision intelligence</a></strong>: Decision intelligence is the discipline of turning information into better action. It involves leveraging data, analytics, and cognitive science to enhance decision-making processes. By understanding and applying decision intelligence, architects can make more informed, evidence-based decisions that lead to better outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understand key <a href="human-decisions">problems of poor decision-making</a>, such as the outcome bias</strong>: Outcome bias occurs when decisions are judged based on their results rather than the quality of the decision-making process itself. Architects need to recognize and mitigate this bias by focusing on the decision-making process, ensuring that decisions are made systematically and rationally, regardless of the outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Know when to use intuition</strong>: Intuition can be a valuable tool in decision-making, especially when data is limited or time is of the essence. Architects should understand when to rely on their intuition and when to seek additional information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understand that there is no such thing as not making a decision</strong>: Delaying or postponing a decision is a decision with its own set of consequences. Architects must know the implications of inaction and understand that deferring decisions can lead to missed opportunities, increased risks, and reduced organizational agility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: Understanding and assessing risks is crucial for making informed decisions. Architects should evaluate potential risks associated with different options and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborative Decision-Making</strong>: Involving relevant stakeholders in decision-making ensures that diverse perspectives are considered, leading to more robust and well-rounded decisions. Architects should facilitate collaboration and consensus-building among team members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong>: Architects must ensure their decisions align with ethical standards and organizational values. These actions involve considering the broader impact of decisions on stakeholders, society, and the environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adaptability and Flexibility</strong>: In a rapidly changing business environment, architects must be adaptable and open to revisiting and revising decisions as new information becomes available. Flexibility allows for continuous improvement and responsiveness to emerging challenges and opportunities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Architects can enhance their ability to influence and drive organizational success by developing these decision-making skills. Whether acting as decision-makers, advisors, or evaluators, architects are critical in steering their organizations toward strategic goals and sustainable growth.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="integrating-skills-for-success">Integrating Skills for Success</h2>

<p>Architects must integrate these diverse skills into a cohesive approach to be truly effective. They must be lifelong learners, continuously updating their knowledge and adapting to new challenges.</p>

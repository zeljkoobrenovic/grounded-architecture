  <p><strong>IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:</strong>  Understand how to apply ideas from David Marquet’s work and Netflix’s valued behaviors to develop architects’ leadership traits.</p>

  <p><strong>KEY POINTS:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet’s work and Netflix’s valued behaviors.</li>
    <li>Marquet focused on leadership and organizational management, particularly emphasizing the principles of Intent-Based Leadership.</li>
    <li>Borrowing from Netflix’s original values, I see the following behavioral traits as crucial for architects: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.</li>

<p>My approach to architecture leadership draws inspiration from two standout sources: <strong><a href="https://davidmarquet.com/">David Marquet’s</a> leadership principles</strong>, articulated in his book “<a href="https://davidmarquet.com/turn-the-ship-around-book/">Turn the Ship Around!</a>” and “<a href="https://davidmarquet.com/leadership-is-language-book/">Leadership Is Language</a>,” and Netflix’s valued behaviors. Marquet’s ideas are about empowering team members, providing clarity, decentralizing decision-making, striving for continuous improvement, and practicing servant leadership. Meanwhile, <strong><a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix’s valued behaviors</a></strong> offers a compact masterclass in coaching and developing people’s leadership traits. Together, these resources form a robust framework for leading with insight and influence in the IT architecture (Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/architects_leadership.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Leadership is one of the three main elements of being an architect (skills, impact, leadership). Having skills and impact without leadership frequently leads to hitting a glass ceiling. Such architects plateau at an intermediate level and cannot direct the company to innovative or transformative solutions.</em></p>

<h2 id="david-marquets-work-the-leader-leader-model">David Marquet’s Work: The Leader-Leader Model</h2>

<p>Marquet’s work is closely tied to <strong>the Leader-Leader model of leadership</strong>, a leadership style where authority is shared across a team or organization instead of being concentrated at the top. In this model, every team member has something valuable to contribute and can work together toward the group’s success.</p>

<p>This leadership approach empowers individuals to <strong>take ownership of their work and collaborate</strong> with others to achieve common goals. Instead of relying on a single leader to make all decisions, authority and responsibility are distributed across the team.</p>

<div class="quote">
The leader-leader model is an excellent standard for architects' leadership vision. Like managers in a leader-leader model, architects should act more as facilitators, coaches, and mentors than traditional top-down decision-makers.

<p>The leader-leader model is an excellent standard for architects’ leadership vision. Like managers in a leader-leader model, architects should act more as <strong>facilitators, coaches, and mentors</strong> than traditional top-down decision-makers. They should provide team members guidance, support, or resources to help them achieve their goals and reach their full potential.</p>

<p>One of the key benefits of a leader-leader model is that it creates <strong>a more collaborative and inclusive work environment</strong>. It allows individuals to contribute their unique perspectives, experiences, and skills to the group, promoting ownership and accountability for the team’s success. This model also <strong>helps build trust and more robust team relationships</strong>, increasing productivity, creativity, and innovation.</p>

<p>David Marquet’s book “Leadership is Language” provides practical advice for leaders looking to create a more collaborative, innovative, and inclusive organizational culture. He emphasizes the importance of language and communication in leadership and introduces the phrase <strong>“I intend to”</strong> as a powerful tool for clarifying intent and <strong>empowering team members</strong> (Figure 2). When team members give intent, the psychological ownership of those actions shifts to them, making them the originators of thought and direction instead of passive followers. This shift in language helps to promote a more collaborative work environment.</p>

<p><br />
I have found a phase “I intend to” to be a powerful catalyst for positioning architecture work. The phrase helps describe the work architect as someone others can expect to <strong>take the initiative and lead efforts</strong>. In addition, this phase captures the desired interaction of the teams with whom architects work, expecting teams to take the initiative and share their intentions, which architects can support and level up.</p>

<p>The <strong>Leader-Leader model</strong> can and has been applied effectively in software engineering and IT architecture. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Empowering Teams:</strong> In Agile environments, authority is often distributed among team members, embodying the Leader-Leader model. Instead of a project manager or lead developer dictating every detail, team members collaborate closely, take ownership of specific tasks, and make decisions within their areas of expertise. This approach empowers developers, testers, and other team members to contribute actively, promoting creativity and innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-functional Collaboration:</strong> In a DevOps environment, the boundaries between development and operations are blurred. Teams are empowered to take end-to-end ownership of the product lifecycle, from development to deployment and monitoring. This shared responsibility encourages collaboration and reduces the reliance on a single decision-maker, aligning closely with the Leader-Leader model.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> DevOps emphasizes continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous feedback. Teams are encouraged to experiment, learn from failures, and improve processes. Leaders in DevOps act as coaches, guiding teams to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation, rather than directing every action.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentoring and Coaching:</strong> Senior architects often take on the role of mentors and coaches rather than top-down decision-makers. They guide less experienced team members through complex architectural challenges, fostering a culture of learning and development. This approach helps build a strong, capable architecture team that can independently contribute to the organization’s success.</li>
  <li><strong>Community-Driven Leadership:</strong> Open source projects often operate under the Leader-Leader model. Contributors from around the world collaborate on projects, and decision-making is distributed across the community. Leaders in open source projects often emerge organically, based on their contributions and the respect they earn from others, rather than through formal authority.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative Problem-Solving:</strong> In open-source communities, problems are solved through collaboration and shared knowledge. Contributors propose solutions, review each other’s code, and collectively decide on the best approaches. This inclusive and collaborative environment encourages innovation and creativity, reflecting the principles of the Leader-Leader model.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized Control:</strong> In a microservices architecture, different teams manage different services independently. Each team is responsible for the full lifecycle of its services, from design to deployment and maintenance. This autonomy aligns with the Leader-Leader model, where each team is empowered to make the best decisions for their service while collaborating with other teams to ensure the overall system’s success.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Ownership:</strong> Teams practicing microservices architecture are encouraged to adopt a “you build it, you run it” philosophy. This ownership means they develop the services and operate and maintain them in production. This ownership fosters accountability and drives teams to improve their services continuously.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all these examples, the Leader-Leader model promotes a collaborative, inclusive, and empowering work environment. Individuals are encouraged to take ownership of their work and contribute to the collective success of the team or organization. This approach enhances productivity and fosters innovation, creativity, and continuous improvement.</p>

<h2 id="netflixs-valued-behaviors-leadership-behaviors">Netflix’s Valued Behaviors: Leadership Behaviors</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix overview of their valued behaviors</a> is a leading inspiration for how I coach and develop architects. The following sections summarize these behaviors, borrowing from the Netflix original values but rearranging them in the order I see as more relevant for architects.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>Architects can only be successful if they are effective communicators. More specifically, as an architect, you need to have the following communication traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are <strong>concise</strong> and articulate in <strong>speech and writing</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>listen well</strong> and <strong>seek to understand</strong> before reacting</li>
  <li>You maintain <strong>calm poise in stressful situations</strong> to draw out the clearest thinking</li>
  <li>You <strong>adapt your communication style</strong> to work well with people from around the world who may not share your native language</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="judgment">Judgment</h3>

<p>People frequently call architects to be objective judges when others cannot agree or need an objective second opinion. As an architect, you’ll be able to make sound judgments if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are good at using <strong>data to inform your intuition</strong></li>
  <li>You make wise <strong>decisions</strong> despite <strong>ambiguity</strong></li>
  <li>You identify <strong>root causes</strong> and go beyond treating symptoms</li>
  <li>You make decisions based on <strong>the long-term</strong>, not near-term</li>
  <li>You <strong>think strategically</strong> and <strong>can articulate</strong> what you are, and are not, trying to do</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="impact">Impact</a> section, the architect’s work should be measured as a benefit for the business. Architects need to ensure that what they are making profits the company. As an architect, you need to show the following impact traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You accomplish significant amounts of <strong>important work</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>make your colleagues better</strong></li>
  <li>You focus on <strong>results over processes</strong></li>
  <li>You demonstrate <strong>consistently</strong> strong performance so <strong>colleagues can rely upon you</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h3>

<p>Architects must work with many different people and groups inclusively. You will be able to do so if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>collaborate</strong> effectively with people of <strong>diverse backgrounds and cultures</strong></li>
  <li>You nurture and <strong>embrace differing perspectives</strong> to make better decisions</li>
  <li>You <strong>focus on talent and values</strong> rather than a person’s similarity to yourself</li>
  <li>You are <strong>curious about how our different backgrounds affect us</strong> at work rather than pretending they don’t affect us</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="selflessness">Selflessness</h3>

<p>Architects always need to consider the best interests of their organizations. This broader view is essential in group conflicts to enable resolutions that benefit the organization. To be able to operate in such a way, you need to show the following selflessness traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You seek what is <strong>best for your organization</strong> rather than what is best for yourself or your group</li>
  <li>You <strong>share information openly and proactively</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>make time to help colleagues</strong></li>
  <li>You are <strong>open-minded</strong> in search of the best ideas</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="courage">Courage</h3>

<p>Being an architect is not always a comfortable position as you will need to be a part of difficult decisions many will not be happy about. You need to have enough courage to make such difficult calls. You will be able to do so if you show the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>say what you think</strong> when it’s in the best interest of your organization, even if it is uncomfortable</li>
  <li>You are willing to be <strong>critical of the status quo</strong></li>
  <li>You make <strong>tough decisions</strong> without agonizing</li>
  <li>You <strong>take smart risks</strong> and are open to possible failure</li>
  <li>You <strong>question actions inconsistent</strong> with the organization’s values</li>
  <li>You <strong>can be vulnerable</strong> in search of truth</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>

<p>Architects need to operate as trusted advisors. Integrity is essential for such a position of architects. To perform successfully as trusted advisor, you need to show the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are known for <strong>honesty</strong>, authenticity, <strong>transparency</strong>, and being <strong>non-political</strong></li>
  <li>You only say things about fellow employees that you <strong>speak to their face</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>admit mistakes</strong> freely and openly</li>
  <li>You <strong>treat people with respect</strong> independent of their status or disagreement with you</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>

<p>As architects, we must proactively identify relevant new technology developments. Based on our understanding of these developments, we must create pragmatic technology recommendations for concrete platforms across the organization. That means that as an architect, you need to stay curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>learn rapidly and eagerly</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>make connections</strong> that others miss</li>
  <li>You seek <strong>alternate perspectives</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>contribute effectively</strong> outside of your specialty</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="innovation">Innovation</h3>

<p>More than curiosity is required. To make an impact as an architect, you need to create helpful innovations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You create <strong>new ideas</strong> that <strong>prove useful</strong></li>
  <li>You keep your organization nimble by <strong>minimizing complexity</strong> and finding time to simplify</li>
  <li>You <strong>re-conceptualize issues</strong> to discover solutions to <strong>hard problems</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>challenge prevailing assumptions</strong> and suggest better approaches</li>
  <li>You <strong>thrive on change</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="passion">Passion</h3>

<p>Architects are frequently role models for others. As such, you need to show the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>inspire others</strong> with your thirst for excellence</li>
  <li>You <strong>care intensely</strong> about your customers and organization’s success</li>
  <li>You are <strong>tenacious and optimistic</strong></li>
  <li>You are <strong>quietly confident</strong> and <strong>openly humble</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Reflect on the Leader-Leader model of leadership model in your work. How can you empower your team members and encourage them to take ownership of their work?</em></li>
  <li><em>Have you acted as a facilitator, coach, or mentor as an architect? Can you share an example of when you gave team members guidance, support, or resources to achieve their goals?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does the phrase “I intend to” resonate with your approach to architecture work? How can it change your perspective on taking the initiative and leading efforts?</em></li>
  <li><em>How effective do you believe your communication skills are?</em></li>
  <li><em>How can you foster an inclusive working environment as an architect? How do you nurture and embrace differing perspectives to make better decisions?</em></li>
  <li><em>Reflect on a situation where you made a decision that was best for the organization rather than what was best for yourself or your group. What was the outcome?</em></li>
  <li><em>Have you ever had to take an uncomfortable stance but in your organization’s best interest?</em></li>
  <li><em>How do you maintain integrity as a trusted advisor in your organization? Can you share an example where your honesty, authenticity, and transparency were vital?</em></li>
  <li><em>How have you maintained your curiosity in your role as an architect? Can you share an instance where your learning eagerness led to a significant outcome?</em></li>
  <li><em>What innovative solutions have you created as an architect? How have these innovations benefitted your organization?</em></li>

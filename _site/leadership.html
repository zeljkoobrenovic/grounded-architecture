<p>My approach to architecture leadership draws inspiration from two sources: <strong><a href="https://davidmarquet.com/">David Marquet’s</a> leadership principles</strong>, as articulated in his book “Turn the Ship Around!” and Netflix’s valued behaviors. Marquet’s ideas emphasize empowering team members, providing clarity, decentralizing decision-making, striving for continuous improvement, and practicing servant leadership. Meanwhile, <strong><a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix valued behaviors</a></strong> offer useful guidance for coaching and developing architects aligned with the “superglue” version.</p>

<h2 id="david-marquets-work-the-leader-leader-model">David Marquet’s Work: The Leader-Leader Model</h2>

<p>Marquet’s work is closely tied to <strong>the Leader-Leader model of leadership</strong>, a style where authority is shared across a team or organization instead of being concentrated at the top. In this model, every team member has something valuable to contribute and can work together toward the group’s success.</p>

<p>This leadership approach empowers individuals to <strong>take ownership of their work and collaborate</strong> with others to achieve common goals. Instead of relying on a single leader to make all decisions, authority, and responsibility are distributed across the team.</p>

<div class="quote">
The leader-leader model is an excellent standard for architects' leadership vision. Like managers in a leader-leader model, architects should act more as facilitators, coaches, and mentors than traditional top-down decision-makers.

<p>The leader-leader model is an excellent standard for architects’ leadership vision. Like managers in a leader-leader model, <strong>architects should act more as facilitators, coaches, and mentors</strong> than traditional top-down decision-makers. They provide team members guidance, support, or resources to help them achieve their goals and reach their full potential.</p>

<p>One of the key benefits of a leader-leader model is that it creates <strong>a more collaborative and inclusive work environment</strong>. It allows individuals to contribute their unique perspectives, experiences, and skills to the group, promoting a sense of ownership and accountability for the team’s success. This model also <strong>helps build trust and stronger relationships within teams</strong>, leading to increased productivity, creativity, and innovation.</p>

</div>

<p>David Marquet’s book “Leadership is Language” provides practical advice for leaders looking to create a more collaborative, innovative, and inclusive organizational culture. He emphasizes the importance of language and communication in leadership and introduces <strong>the phrase “I intend to”</strong> as a powerful tool for clarifying intent and <strong>empowering team members</strong> (Figure 1). When team members give intent, the psychological ownership of those actions shifts to them, making them the originators of thought and direction instead of passive followers. This shift in language helps to promote a more collaborative work environment.</p>

<p><br />
I have found a phase “I intend to” to be a powerful catalyst for positioning architecture work. The phrase helps describe the work <strong>architect as someone others expect to take the initiative and lead efforts</strong>. But also to describe the desired interaction of architects with the teams they work with, where we hope teams share their intentions which architects can help improve.</p>

<h2 id="netflix-valued-behaviors-leadership-behaviors">Netflix Valued Behaviors: Leadership Behaviors</h2>

<p>I have found the <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix overview of their valued behaviors</a> to be a leading inspiration for how I coach and develop architects. The following sections summarize these behaviors, borrowing from the Netflix original values but rearranging them in the order I see as more relevant for architects.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>Architects can only be successful if they are effective communicators. More specifically, as an architect, you need to have the following communication traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are <strong>concise</strong> and articulate in <strong>speech and writing</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>listen well</strong> and <strong>seek to understand</strong> before reacting</li>
  <li>You maintain <strong>calm poise in stressful situations</strong> to draw out the clearest thinking</li>
  <li>You <strong>adapt your communication style</strong> to work well with people from around the world who may not share your native language</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="judgment">Judgment</h3>

<p>People frequently call architects to be objective judges when others cannot agree or need an objective second opinion. As an architect, you’ll be able to make sound judgments if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are good at using <strong>data to inform your intuition</strong></li>
  <li>You make wise <strong>decisions</strong> despite <strong>ambiguity</strong></li>
  <li>You identify <strong>root causes</strong>, and go beyond treating symptoms</li>
  <li>You make decisions based on <strong>the long term</strong>, not near term</li>
  <li>You <strong>think strategically</strong>, and <strong>can articulate</strong> what you are, and are not, trying to do</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="superglue">Architects as Superglue</a>, the architect’s impact should be measured as a benefit for the business. Architects need to ensure that what they are making profits the company. As an architect, you need to show the following impact traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You accomplish significant amounts of <strong>important work</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>make your colleagues better</strong></li>
  <li>You focus on <strong>results over process</strong></li>
  <li>You demonstrate <strong>consistently</strong> strong performance so <strong>colleagues can rely upon you</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h3>

<p>As superglue, architects need to work with many different people and groups inclusively.  You will be able to do so if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>collaborate</strong> effectively with people of <strong>diverse backgrounds and cultures</strong></li>
  <li>You nurture and <strong>embrace differing perspectives</strong> to make better decisions</li>
  <li>You <strong>focus on talent and values</strong>, rather than a person’s similarity to yourself</li>
  <li>You are <strong>curious about how our different backgrounds affect us</strong> at work, rather than pretending they don’t affect us</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="selflessness">Selflessness</h3>

<p>Architects always need to consider the best interests of their organizations. This broader view is essential in group conflicts to enable resolutions that benefit the organization. To be able to operate in such way, you need to show the following selflessness traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You seek what is <strong>best for your organization</strong>, rather than what is best for yourself or your group</li>
  <li>You <strong>share information openly and proactively</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>make time to help colleagues</strong></li>
  <li>You are <strong>open-minded</strong> in search of the best ideas</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="courage">Courage</h3>

<p>Being an architect is not always a comfortable position as you will need to be a part of difficult decisions many will not be happy about. You need to have enough courage to make such difficult calls. You will be able to do so if you show the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>say what you think</strong> when it’s in the best interest of your organization, even if it is uncomfortable</li>
  <li>You are willing to be <strong>critical of the status quo</strong></li>
  <li>You make <strong>tough decisions</strong> without agonizing</li>
  <li>You <strong>take smart risks</strong> and are open to possible failure</li>
  <li>You <strong>question actions inconsistent</strong> with organization’s values</li>
  <li>You are <strong>able to be vulnerable</strong>, in search of truth</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>

<p>Architects need to operate as trusted advisors. Integrity is essential for such a position of architects. To operates successfully as trusted advisor, you need to show the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are known for <strong>candor</strong>, authenticity, <strong>transparency</strong>, and being <strong>non-political</strong></li>
  <li>You only say things about fellow employees that you <strong>say to their face</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>admit mistakes</strong> freely and openly</li>
  <li>You <strong>treat people with respect</strong> independent of their status or disagreement with you</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>

<p>As architects, we must proactively identify relevant new technology developments. Based on our understanding of these developments, we must create pragmatic technology recommendations for concrete platforms across the organization. That means that as architect, you need to stay curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>learn rapidly and eagerly</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>make connections</strong> that others miss</li>
  <li>You seek <strong>alternate perspectives</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>contribute effectively</strong> outside of your specialty</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="innovation">Innovation</h3>

<p>More than curiosity is required. To make an impact as an architect, you need to create useful innovations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You create <strong>new ideas</strong> that <strong>prove useful</strong></li>
  <li>You keep your organization nimble by <strong>minimizing complexity</strong> and finding time to simplify</li>
  <li>You <strong>re-conceptualize issues</strong> to discover solutions to <strong>hard problems</strong></li>
  <li>You <strong>challenge prevailing assumptions</strong>, and suggest better approaches</li>
  <li>You <strong>thrive on change</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="passion">Passion</h3>

<p>Architects are frequently role models for others. As such you need to show the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>inspire others</strong> with your thirst for excellence</li>
  <li>You <strong>care intensely</strong> about your customers and organization’s success</li>
  <li>You are <strong>tenacious and optimistic</strong></li>
  <li>You are <strong>quietly confident</strong> and <strong>openly humble</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

  <li><em>Reflect on the Leader-Leader model of leadership in your work. How can you empower your team members and encourage them to take ownership of their work?</em></li>
  <li><em>Have you acted as a facilitator, coach, or mentor as an architect? Can you share an example of when you gave team members guidance, support, or resources to achieve their goals?</em></li>

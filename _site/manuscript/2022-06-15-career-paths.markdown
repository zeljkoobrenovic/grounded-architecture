Hiring and developing architects will differ significantly per organization. Nevertheless, here I share some of the ideas and lessons learned here.

## Typical Architect's Career Paths

My view of architecture has a strong engineering bias. Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background. While there may be exceptions, without significant real-world exposure to software engineering challenges, an architect cannot obtain enough practical knowledge to make technology decisions and build relations with developer teams. 




Regarding career progression, Figure 1 shows an example of architecture career paths in relation to engineering, which I used to define architecture career paths.

Stepping from an engineering position to an architecture requires three changes:
* Getting a broader scope of work,
* Having a higher diversity of work, and 
* Changing skills, as communication and influencer skills become crucial aspects of success.

All architect are responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within some critical area. They need to combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.

After the role of an Architect, I usually envision three tracks of progression:
* **Senior Architect**, a generalist with broader responsibilities to, who digs deep into complex issues and identifies a suitable course of action. They often navigate from one critical area to another, guided by the organization's direction.
* **Principal Architect**, a senior architect with a special focus on some area of strategic interest for an organization (e.g., data, distributed systems, frontend).
* **Enterprise Architect**, being closer to product, management, strategy, and business functions, frequently serving as senior engineering leaders' right hand. 

But an architect's path can take many different directions and have many other names. More important than a formal title is a continuous search for staying relevant and making an impact as a [superglue](#superglue).


## Hiring Architects

Developing and hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure. Having more architects does not necessarily leads to a better team. Having good alignment and diversity of perspective is even more important for an architecture team than for other groups.




It is vital to take more active ownership of hiring architects. Due to the vast diversity of how different companies define the architect's role, recruiters may need help understanding the role's requirements.

While you will need to design your hiring process, the hiring process should ensure a solid evaluation of the candidate's:
  * **[Technical skills](#skills)**: An architect must possess a strong technical background in the relevant areas, such as software development, infrastructure, cloud computing, and security. The process can assess their expertise through technical questions, tests, or case studies.
  * **[Communication and collaboration skills](#skills)**: Architects often work with stakeholders, including business leaders, developers, and project managers. Therefore, the process could evaluate the candidate's ability to communicate effectively, work in a team, and manage stakeholders.
  * **[Leadership and problem-solving abilities](#impact)**: As a senior member of the team, an architect should have strong leadership skills and the ability to solve complex problems. The process could assess the candidate's experience leading teams, making critical decisions, and resolving technical challenges.
  * **[Cultural fit](Leadership)**: The initial screening could also evaluate the candidate's fit with the company's culture, values, and mission. The cultural fit is vital to ensure the candidate shares the same vision and will likely thrive in the organization.

In terms of steps, I typically work with some version of the following process (after standard recruitment screening):

* **Step 1: Initial Screening Interview with Chief Architect**
  * Typical duration 60 min
  * In this step, it is crucial to assess the candidate's overall fit for the role and determine whether they possess the necessary skills, experience, and qualifications. 
  * Overall, the initial screening aims to identify the most promising candidates who possess the necessary skills, experience, and fit for the role of a senior solutions architect and who should proceed to the next stage of the interview process.
  * Extra focus on:
    * Determining cultural fit
    * Understanding the candidate's leadership and problem-solving abilities
    
* **Step 2: In-Depth Interview with Senior/Principle/Enterprise Architects**
  * Typical duration 90 min
  * Extra focus on:
    * Evaluating the candidate's technical skills
    * Assessing the candidate's communication and collaboration skills
    * Understanding the candidate's leadership and problem-solving abilities

* **Step 3: In-Depth Interview with Architects and Senior Engineers**
  * Typical duration 90 min
  * Preparation:
      * A document describing a recent solution architecture of a candidate, providing the content for discussion and helping estimate the candidate's written skills.
      * (Optional) open-source code review of a candidate
  * Extra focus on:
    * Any topics identified during Step 2 as areas that needed to explore further.
  
For senior positions, I typically introduce an additional step of meeting senior leadership:
* **Step 4: Non-technical stakeholders evaluation**
  * Interview with Engineering Leaders
  * Interview with Product and Business Function Leaders (e.g., CPO, CMO, CFO)
  * Interview with a CTO
  * Extra focus on:
   * Understanding the candidate's leadership abilities
   * Assessing the candidate's communication and collaboration skills

With the described steps, you can get a solid overview of all critical aspects of superglue architects. In particular, the involvement of people outside architecture or engineering is crucial to minimize risk related to a lack of interest and ability to engage with all relevant stakeholders.

When it comes to product development, I generally recommend the book "[Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42611483-escaping-the-build-trap)" by Melissa Perri. This book is a guide intended to help organizations shift their focus from simply building and shipping products to creating value for their customers. The "build trap" refers to the common pitfall where companies become fixated on building more features and products without considering whether they meet customer needs or generate desired outcomes.




Perri explores the reasons behind the build trap and provides practical strategies to help businesses escape it by adopting a value-centric, customer-focused approach. The main message is that by understanding customer needs, adopting a customer-centric approach, and embracing innovation and agility, companies can increase their chances of developing successful products that stand out in the market.

In addition to numerous insights for architects, the book provides the following valuable tips necessary for architects' good interaction with product development:
* Recognizing bad product-development approaches
* Recognizing bad product manager archetypes
* Know how a good product development process looks like

## Bad Product Companies Archetypes

The product trap occurs when businesses focus too much on their product's features and functionalities, overlooking their customers' actual needs and preferences. Value, from a business perspective, is pretty straightforward. It can fuel your business: money, data, knowledge capital, or promotion. Every feature you build, and any initiative you take as a company should result in some outcome that is tied back to that business value.

Many companies are, instead, led by sales, visionaries, or technology. All of these ways of organizing can land you in the build trap.

1. **Sales-led companies** let their contracts define their product strategy. The product roadmap and direction were driven by what was promised to customers without aligning with the overall strategy.
2. **Visionary-led companies** can be very powerful — when you have the right visionary. But there aren't too many Steve Jobses floating around. Also, when that visionary leaves, the product direction usually crumbles. Operating as a visionary-led company is not sustainable.
3. **The technology-led companies** are driven by the latest and coolest technology. The problem is that they often lack a market-facing, value-led strategy.

## Bad Product Manager Archetypes

The fundamental role of the product manager in the organization is to work with a team to create the right product that balances meeting business needs with solving user problems. Product managers connect the dots. They take input from customer research, expert information, market research, business direction, experiment results, and data analysis.

To better understand the role of a product manager, it is useful to understand three bad product manager archetypes:

* **The Mini-CEO:** Product managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product, yet most job postings for product managers describe them as the mini-CEO. CEOs have sole authority over many things. Product managers can’t change many things a CEO can do in an organization. They especially don’t have authority over people because they are not people managers at the team level. Instead, they must influence them to move in a specific direction. Out of this wonderful CEO myth emerged an archetype of a very arrogant product manager who thinks they rule the world.
* **The Waiter:** The waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is an order taker. They go to their stakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those desires into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal, vision, or decision-making involved. More often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized. Instead of discovering problems, waiters ask, “What do you want?” The customer asks for a specific solution, which these product managers implement. The waiter approach leads to what David J. Bland is calling the Product Death Cycle.


* **The Former Project Manager**: Product managers are not project managers, although some project management is needed to execute the role correctly. Project managers are responsible for the when. When will a project finish? Is everyone on track? Will we hit our deadline? Product managers are responsible for the why? Why are we building this? How does it deliver value to our customers? How does it help meet the goals of the business? The latter questions are more challenging to answer than the former, and product managers who don’t understand their roles often resort to doing that type of work. Many companies still think the project manager and product manager are the same. 



## How a Good Product Development Approach Looks Like

Product-led companies understand that the success of their products is the primary driver of growth and value for their company. They prioritize, organize, and strategize around product success. 

Critical elements of successful product-led companies include:

2. **Understanding Customer Needs**: Successful companies understand customer needs, desires, and expectations to develop successful products. Businesses can gain valuable insights and tailor their products by conducting thorough market research and engaging with customers.

3. **Adopting a Customer-Centric Approach**: Organizations need to adopt a customer-centric approach to product development to avoid the product trap. This approach means prioritizing customer satisfaction and incorporating their feedback throughout the entire product development process.

4. **Executing Iterative Product Development**: Iterative product development is essential, continuously testing and refining the product based on customer feedback. An iterative process helps businesses identify and address potential issues before they become significant problems.

5. **Aligning Business Goals with Customer Needs**: Businesses should align their goals and objectives with the needs of their customers. Doing so can ensure that their products deliver value and create a robust and loyal customer base.

6. **Embracing Innovation and Agility**: Businesses must be innovative and agile to adapt to rapidly changing customer preferences and market conditions. This adaptivity includes staying informed about the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in product development.

7. **Measuring Success**: Accurately measuring a product's success is essential. Such measuring involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and using data-driven insights to make informed product improvements and enhancements decisions.

## Introductions

### Introduction
* *This book aims to share my approach to running an IT architecture practice in larger organizations based on my experience at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta. I call this approach "Grounded Architecture"—architecture with strong foundations and deep roots.*
* *Prioritizing people interactions and data over processes and tools, Grounded Architecture aims to connect architecture practice to all organizational levels as an antidote to the "ivory tower" architecture.*
* *I also explain my motivation to write this book.*

### Context: Fast-Moving Global Organizations
* To better understand any idea or solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which this idea developed. 
* The Grounded Architecture approach has evolved in the context of global, loosely coupled organizations that are diverse, with non-linear growth dynamics, and under transformation pressures. 

### Goals
* I identified the following needs that an architecture function should support: Executing At Scale, Adaptivity, Increasing the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, and Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning.

## Grounded Architecture: Introduction

### Data Foundation
* The architecture Data Foundation serves as a medium to create a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of technology landscapes of big organizations. 
* The Data Foundation provides an architecture-centric view of data about a technology landscape based on source code analyses, public cloud billing reports, vibrancy reports, or incident tickets.
* To facilitate the creation of a Data Foundation, I have been working on creating open-source tools, such as [Sokrates](https://sokrates.dev), that can help obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories.

### People Foundation
* Developing the architecture function requires having competent, empowered, and motivated architects. Architecture practice must carefully organize, empower, and leverage scarce talent.
* In my work in the past few years, I combined two teams of architects: a small central architecture team and a cross-organizational distributed virtual team.

### Architecture Activities Platform
* The Architecture Activities Platform is a system of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging Data and People Foundations to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.
* Examples of activities include: supporting teams in their daily work; tracking tech debt, defining tech debt reduction programs; performing technical due diligence; standardizing processes and documentation; defining cloud, data, and platform strategies.

### Value of Grounded Architecture Structure
* When a Grounded Architecture structure is in place, it can significantly impact an organization's functioning.
* These impact categories are Executing At Scale, Increasing the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning, and Higher Adaptivity.

## Being Architect: Introduction

### Architects as Superglue
* Architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.
* Architects need to be technically strong. But their unique strengths should stem from being able to relate technical issues with business and broader issues.
* Architects should stand on three legs: Skills, Impact, and Leadership.

### Skills
* A typical skillset of an architect includes hard (technical) skills, soft (people & social) skills, product development, and business skills.

### Impact
* Architects' work is evaluated based on their impact on the organization. 
* Architects can make an impact via three pillars: Big-Picture Thinking, Execution, and Leveling-Up.

### Leadership
* My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet's work and Netflix's valued behaviors.
* Marquet focused on leadership and organizational management, particularly emphasizing the principles of Intent-Based Leadership.
* Borrowing from Netflix's original values, the following behavioral traits are crucial for architects: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.

### Architects' Career Paths: Raising the Bar
* Architects' career paths ideally stem from a strong engineering background.
* Hiring architects requires constantly raising the bar to ensure a strong and diverse team structure.  

## Doing Architecture: Introduction

### The Culture Map: Architects' Culture Mindfield Compass
* I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a beneficial tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from various cultures and backgrounds.
* Meyer’s model contains eight scales, each representing a key area, showing how cultures vary from extreme to extreme: Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling.

### Managing Organizational Complexity: Six Simple Rules
* Six Simple Rules emphasizes that in today’s complicated business environment, you must set up organizational structures based on cooperation. 
* To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating. 
* This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture.

### Understanding Product Development
* When it comes to product development, I generally recommend two resources for architects: “Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value” by Melissa Perri and “The Discipline of Market Leader” by Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema. 
* The build trap occurs when businesses focus too much on their product’s features and functionalities, overlooking customers’ needs and preferences.
* The Discipline of Market Leader highlights three strategic paths a company can use to achieve market leadership: operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy. 

### Architecture Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates
* Grounded Architecture supports governance models adaptable to organizations' complex and diverse needs. A technology governance model should be a well-balanced hybrid of three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.
* Nudging is a form of governing where you create subtle or indirect suggestions influencing someone's behavior or decision-making without forcing them or limiting their freedom of choice.
* Governing with taxes (economic incentives) is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to "pay" some form of taxes on used resources.
* With mandates and bans, you guide people by explicitly defining what they should or should not do.

### Economic Modeling: ROI and Financial Options
* Architects are frequently asked about the (economic) value of architecture or technology investments.
* Answering this question is a crucial skill for any senior architect. But it may be difficult to answer this seemingly harmless question concisely and convincingly to a non-technical audience.
* Borrowing from existing literature, I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of architecture: the return on investment metaphor and the selling options metaphor.

**IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:** Get an overview of three resources in the appendix.

As we bring this book to a close, I would like to equip you with a helpful appendix. In this part, I outline three resources that have proven vital in my journey as an IT architect and have reminded me about what I always need to know about crucial aspects of IT practice. I routinely refer back to them and carry them in my practitioner "backpack," so I added their summaries in the appendix.

* **EIC/ISO 25010 Standard:** This standard focuses on product quality and system quality models. While imperfect, this standard is a reasonably complete yet compact source for understanding software maintainability, security, reliability, and performance efficiency. 

* **Cloud Design Patterns** offer a mix of crucial distributed system and messaging system topics combined with modern public cloud engineering themes.

* **Characteristics of High Performing Organizations** from the 'Accelerate' book by
Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim is excellent sources of empirical knowledge about key practices of high-performing technology organizations.

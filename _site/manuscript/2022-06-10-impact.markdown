Architects' work is evaluated based on **their impact on the organization**. Their contributions are typically assessed through the following key areas:

* **Identifying, Tackling, and Delivering on Strategic Problems**: Architects are responsible for recognizing and addressing strategic issues at both the organizational and area-specific levels (such as domains or technical areas). Their work must align with the broader strategic objectives of the organization, ensuring that their efforts are prioritized to support global goals. By tackling these strategic problems, architects contribute to the overall direction and success of the organization, providing solutions that align with long-term visions and targets.

* **Having a Deep and Broad Influence**: Architects must have a profound and extensive impact on their specific domain, product, or technology area. This requires them to delve deeply into particular critical issues, providing targeted solutions that address pressing challenges. Simultaneously, they need to maintain a broad perspective, creating value by leveraging their solutions across multiple teams and projects. This dual focus ensures that their influence is both specific and widespread, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization.

Their unique combination of hard technical skills and soft skills in strategy, execution, and people management enables them to navigate complex challenges and drive significant progress. By leveraging these skills, architects can move the organization forward, ensuring that the solutions they deliver are both innovative and implementable, fostering growth and development across the board.

Architects make a significant impact by identifying and solving strategic problems, exerting deep and broad influence across domains, and delivering unique solutions through a blend of technical expertise and strategic leadership. This multifaceted approach ensures that their work is not only aligned with organizational objectives but also drives substantial progress and innovation.

## Pillars of Impact

Architects must possess **strong technical, people, and business skills**, which are ideally developed through extensive practice and experience. Building on this robust foundation, architects need to cultivate specific competencies that enable them to leverage their experiences and abilities to **positively impact organizational performance**. As architects advance in their careers, their competency development should be increasingly driven by the desired impact on the organization rather than solely on acquiring new skills. 

I typically coach architects within the framework of concrete activities, focusing on real-world challenges and guiding their development through hands-on involvement in appropriate actions. This practical approach helps tailor their skill development to address specific challenges and achieve the expected impact in practice.

To develop architects, I draw inspiration from Staff Engineering roles. Tanya Reilly's book *[The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)* and Will Larson's book *[Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/)* provide valuable insights into defining the responsibilities and expectations of architects.

Inspired by *The Staff Engineer's Path* by Tanya Reilly (Figure 1), I categorize the competencies that enable architects to make an impact into three groups:

* **Big-picture Thinking**: Architects need to develop the ability to see the broader context of their work. This involves understanding how their architectural decisions align with organizational goals, market trends, and technological advancements. Big-picture thinking allows architects to foresee potential challenges and opportunities, ensuring their designs are future-proof and scalable. This competency involves strategic planning, vision setting, and the ability to articulate how technical solutions contribute to overall business objectives.

* **Execution**: Execution is about turning ideas into reality. Architects must be adept at implementing their designs and ensuring that projects are completed efficiently and effectively. This involves project management skills, the ability to coordinate with cross-functional teams, and a deep understanding of the technical intricacies involved in bringing a project to fruition. Architects must also be capable of troubleshooting issues, adapting to changes, and ensuring that the final deliverables meet the required standards and expectations.

* **Leveling Up**: Leveling up refers to the continuous improvement of both the architect's skills and the capabilities of their teams. Architects must be committed to personal growth and the development of those around them. This involves mentoring junior team members, fostering a culture of learning, and staying abreast of the latest technological advancements and industry best practices. Architects should also focus on enhancing the overall skill set of their teams, ensuring that knowledge and expertise are shared and that the team collectively grows stronger and more capable.

By focusing on these three competency groups—big-picture thinking, execution, and leveling up—architects can significantly enhance their impact on organizational performance. This structured approach to competency development ensures that architects are not only skilled practitioners but also strategic leaders capable of driving meaningful change and innovation within their organizations.

### Big-Picture Thinking 

Architects are often the only individuals within an organization who possess a **"helicopter view,"** allowing them to oversee vast domains and anticipate the broader consequences of decisions.

These tools help team members understand how their work fits into the larger organizational context and the impact of their contributions. Through workshops, presentations, and collaborative tools, architects can disseminate their vision, fostering a culture of strategic awareness.

* **Zooming In and Out**: Architects have the rare ability to both maintain a strategic overview and delve into implementation details when necessary. This flexibility allows them to bridge the gap between high-level strategy and on-the-ground execution. They can provide strategic guidance while also engaging deeply with technical teams to ensure that the finer details align with broader organizational goals. This dual capability ensures that strategic initiatives are feasible and that practical implementations stay aligned with the overall vision.

* **Rooting Out Inefficiencies**: Using their big-picture perspective, architects are adept at identifying and eliminating inefficiencies within organizational processes and systems. They can lead the adoption of new technologies and processes that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of multiple teams. By doing so, architects help streamline operations, reduce redundancies, and improve overall performance. This proactive approach to efficiency ensures that the organization remains competitive and can adapt to changing market conditions and technological advancements.

Architects play a pivotal role in organizations by leveraging their helicopter view to identify high-leverage points, help others understand the big picture, seamlessly transition between strategic and detailed thinking, and root out inefficiencies. Their ability to see and act on the broader context makes them invaluable in driving organizational success and fostering a culture of strategic innovation.

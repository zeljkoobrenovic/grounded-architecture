A> **KEY POINTS:**
A> * I introduce three elements of Grounded Architecture: The Data Pillar, The People Pillar, The Architecture Activities Platform.

In this part, I will introduce the structure of Grounded Architecture. I chose the term "Grounded Architecture" to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is to **avoid having an "ivory tower" architecture function** disconnected from the organization, which in a [fast-moving, global, and diverse setting](#context) is a real danger. In other words, I wanted to create an architectural function that is **well grounded in the organization**.

Grounded Architecture as an approach to setting organizational structures for architecture practice has three elements:
* The Data Pillar,
* The People Pillar,
* The Architecture Activities Platform.

The *Data Pillar* is **a system of tools and resources** that enables architects to make **data-informed decisions** based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization's technology landscape. The [Data Pillar section](#data) provides more details.

The *People Pillar* is **a network of people** doing architecture across the organization. This Pillar is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any **tangible impact**. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, to transform an organization, you do not need to solve mathematical equations; you need to move people. The [People Pillar section](#people) provides more details.

Lastly, the *Architecture Activities Platform* defines **a set of processes and agreements** enabling architects to do everything that architecture typically does, leveraging data and People Pillars to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact. The [Architecture Activites Platform section](#activities-platform) provides more details on Architecture Activities Platform. 

The Architecture Activities Platform is **only valid with the healthy Data and People Pillars**. Without data and people connections, an Architecture Activities Platform becomes an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.

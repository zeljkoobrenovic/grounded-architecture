  <p><strong>KEY POINTS:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The architecture data pillar serves as a medium to create a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of technology landscapes of big organizations.</li>
    <li>The data pillar provides an architecture-centric view on data about a technology landscape based on source code analyses, public cloud billing reports, vibrancy reports, or incident tickets.</li>
    <li>I have been working on creating open-source tools, such as <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>, that can help obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In every place I worked on creating architectural functions, I strongly emphasized data. In the past several years, I have been working on creating open-source tools, such as <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>, that can help obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories or public cloud billing reports. Consequently, one of the first steps I make in any architecture role is to create an architecture data pillar to get a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of the technology landscapes of an organization. Manual documentation does not scale in <a href="context">our context</a>, and relying on data ensures reliability and scalability.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-data.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The good news is that big organizations have lots of data that, if used wisely, can provide an excellent basis for an architectural data pillar. With some automation and curation, getting a good overview of the technology landscape may be closer than it initially appears.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="examples-of-data-sources-and-tools">Examples of Data Sources and Tools</h2>

<p>I’ve always aimed to get reliable data about technology with as much as possible automation. Some examples of data I used include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Source code</strong>, which contains an incredible amount of information about technology, people’s activity, team dependencies, and the quality of software systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Public cloud billing reports</strong>, which provide an overview and trends used cloud services, regions, and budgets.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident reports</strong>, which can reveal trends and dependencies among incidents.</li>
  <li><strong>Key business metrics</strong>, like vibrancy, which can show user activity on our systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Messaging and collaboration platform (such as Slack) activity reports</strong>, which can help understand discussion topics and team interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following sections, I detail several of these architectural data-driven tools.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/apps.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" />
<br />
<strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>A screenshot of the start page of the architecture data dashboard we’ve built and used at AVIV Group.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-1-source-code-and-commit-history">Example 1: Source Code and Commit History</h3>

<p>I have repeatably found the source code to be an incredible source for creating data-driven architecture documentation. Source code and its commit history include an astonishing amount of information about technology, people activity, team dependencies, and the quality of software systems. I’ve started and still actively maintain the project <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>, with the idea to help further extract data from source code that can help my work as an architect. I use Sokrates daily, improving it on the way.</p>

<p>I have designed Sokrates from an architect’s point of view, enabling quick zooming in and out into source code landscapes. On the one hand, Sokrates provides a high-level view of the landscape, summarizing data from all teams and groups. At the same time, you can zoom in on the details of particular systems to the code level. That means you can use the same tools to have CTO-level discussions looking at overall trends in our technology usage and costs. At the same time, I could engage with developers and discuss concrete code fragments and potential improvements in the code level (e.g., duplicated blocks, complex units, dependencies).</p>

<p>The Appendix at the end of this section shows some insights from source code analyses with Sokrates. For more complex examples of insights that Sokrates generates from source code, take a look at <a href="https://www.sokrates.dev/">Sokrates examples</a>, with analysis of complex open-source landscapes, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/asf/_sokrates_landscape/index.html"><strong>Apache Software Foundation Repositories</strong></a>, with aggregated multi-level analysis of more than 1,000 repositories with more than 180 million lines of code, more than 22,000 historical contributors, and 2.4 million commits.</li>
  <li><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/meta/_sokrates_landscape/index.html"><strong>Facebook/Meta OSS Repositories</strong></a>, with aggregated multi-level analysis of around 800 repositories with 120 million lines of code, more than 20,000 historical contributors, and more than 2 million commits.</li>
  <li><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/microsoft/_sokrates_landscape/index.html"><strong>Microsoft OSS Repositories</strong></a>, with aggregated multi-level analysis of more than 2,400 repositories with more than 100 million lines of code, more than 18,000 historical contributors, and more than 1.2 million commits.</li>
  <li><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/google/_sokrates_landscape/index.html"><strong>Google OSS Repositories</strong></a>, with aggregated multi-level analysis of more than 1,600 repositories with more than 200 million lines of code, more than 27,000 historical contributors, and more than 2.4 million commits.</li>
  <li><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/asf/_sokrates_landscape/index.html"><strong>Linux Source Code</strong></a>, with aggregated multi-level analysis of 178 Linux repository sub-folders with more than 23 million lines of code, more than 17,000 historical contributors, and more than 1.7 million commits.</li>
  <li><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/amzn/_sokrates_landscape/index.html"><strong>Amazon OSS Repositories</strong></a>, with aggregated multi-level analysis of more than 2,700 repositories with more than 130 million lines of code, more than 13,000 historical contributors, and more than 600,000 commits.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to standard source code and commit history analyses, I also have built several special source code analyses to get further details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Travis and Jenkins files analyzers to understand how teams build CI/CD pipelines.</li>
  <li>Dockerfile scan to create a tech radar of runtime technologies.</li>
  <li>GitHub API pull requests analyses to identify deployment frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I encourage you to experiment with your source-code analyses.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-2-public-cloud-usage">Example 2: Public Cloud Usage</h3>

<p>Migrating to the public cloud can dramatically increase transparency thanks to uniform automation and monitoring. The public cloud transparency offers an incredible amount of valuable data out-of-box.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the anonymous screenshot of the Cloud usage explorer, a tool I built to visualize automatically-collected data from standard Google Cloud Platform (GCP) usage reports.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/archdata/cloud-usage-explorer.png" alt="" />
<br />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> An example of a cloud usage explorer.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a>, and other Public Cloud Providers give detailed data about which platform uses which services, resource family, and budget. You can also understand which people and teams have access to each service. It is possible to get real-time information about cloud usage and understand the trends fully automatically.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-3-financial-and-vibrancy-data">Example 3: Financial and Vibrancy Data</h3>

<p>Finance departments are very data-driven and have high-quality data that could be relevant for architects. In addition to standard costs, budgets, and other pure financial data types, I frequently found that finance teams also have different data sources, such as vibrancy or usage levels. These teams need such data to, for instance, correlate finance performance with usage levels. Such usage data are beneficial for architecture discussions. For example, linking usage levels and vibrancy of systems with their public cloud usage can identify areas of improvement and inefficiencies.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="using-architecture-data-pillar">Using Architecture Data Pillar</h2>

<p>The architecture data pillar can provide lots of data. Sometimes, as in an ordinary map or atlas, such data could be helpful for those who want to orient themselves and understand the context. But you could obtain more insights from such data. However, finding the right ways to interpret and use data requires active effort. In other words, the data can give you the answers, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">we may not know the questions</a>. Here are some of the questions I frequently ask and answers with data from the documents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are we aligned and going in the same direction? Tools like source code overviews, public cloud usage explorers, or tech radars can highlight differences and trigger discussions.</li>
  <li>Are we using technology optimally? Comparing usage trends between teams can show interesting outliners (both positive and negative).</li>
  <li>Are there indicators of poor code quality? Too large systems, duplication, long units, or long files.</li>
  <li>Productivity: is more really more or is more actually less. For instance, comparing the number of git merges with the number of developers can indicate if our dev processes are scalable. When we scale up teams, we want to speed up our delivery (but if team structure is not proper, it can easily be the opposite as people “step on each other toes”).</li>
  <li>Do we collaborate in the way we want? Repository analysis can point out team topologies and (un)desired dependencies.</li>
  <li>Do we work on the things we want? We may want to focus more on innovations, but in reality, we may spend too much time on legacy maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="building-data-pillar">Building Data Pillar</h2>

<p>While each organization will have its unique sets of data, here are some tips I found helpful in my approach to forming the architecture data pillar:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Start with the source code</strong>. My motto is “Talk is expensive. Show me the code.” I scan as soon as possible all source code using tools such as <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>. I highly recommend <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a> as the basis for the data pillar, but other simple analyses could also provide a good starting point. Modern IT enterprises store almost everything as a code. It is the richest and most up-to-date documentation on most things happening in an IT enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect with finance and governance teams</strong> to get exports of their data (without sensitive parts, such as revenue projections). Cloud billing reports and data about vibrancy or revenue streams are collected anyway. By extracting more technology-oriented data (e.g., public cloud technology usage trends) and connecting them to other data, many new insights may be obtained without starting new processes or asking people to provide more details. First, leverage what you have, squeeze all the value from it, then ask people for any missing elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Use simple and easy-to-maintain infrastructures</strong>. For example, I publish the results of Sokrates analyses and other simple data Web apps as static resources in our enterprise GithHub pages. Configuring more complex infrastructure with complex databases and backend software requires more maintenance.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain a culture of transparency</strong>. It is much simpler a more effective to share fewer data with everyone than to have more data, but complex authorization is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Own the curation</strong>. People need to be able to trust your data. Spend enough time to understand data sets, curate them, and ensure presentation consistency. I am a master curator and chief UX designer of a data pillar.</li>
  <li><strong>Build maps, not control units</strong>. The main inspiration for my work is map-making. As noted by Brené Brown, maps are one of the most critical documents in human history (see <a href="https://brenebrown.com/book/atlas-of-the-heart/">Atlas of the Heart</a> for a discussion on a mapmaking metaphor). They give us tools to store and exchange knowledge about space and place. While there are differences between maps and the layers they show, the one thing that all maps do is provide readers with orientation. A sense of place is central to meaning-making. Maps are also composed of multiple layers. Similarly, the architecture data pillar offers data layers about systems, describing their size, connections, quality, security, or human activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I do not want to prescribe the best technology, I can tell what I use in daily work. I build most architecture data tools as simple web applications, taking data from JSON files hosted on a static web server. See some of <a href="https://obren.io/tools">my public tools</a> to illustrate how I build such simple data-driven web apps.</p>

<p><br />
Have you ever wondered how to run an IT architecture practice without <strong>feeling isolated in an ivory tower</strong>, detached from your organization’s people, problems, and realities?</p>

<p>If so, this book is for you.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta, I introduce an approach I call <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong>. This <strong>practical, human-centered method</strong> emphasizes connecting to real-world challenges, real-time data, and real people.</p>

<p>Grounded Architecture is about <strong>keeping your feet on the ground</strong> rather than floating above the fray. It focuses on <strong>making architecture relevant, collaborative, and responsive</strong> to our fast-paced environments. It redefines architecture not as a set of abstract frameworks but as a living, evolving discipline rooted in relationships, results, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>In too many organizations, architects are viewed as distant wizards casting spells from a tower—producing documents no one reads and models no one uses. Grounded Architecture challenges that perception by <strong>promoting an architecture practice embedded in the organization’s fabric</strong>, which is connected to strategy, delivery, operations, and, most importantly, people.</p>

<p>This approach places data and collaboration at the center rather than relying on heavy-handed processes or over-engineered tools. It <strong>draws inspiration from Grounded Theory</strong>, a research methodology that develops theories from real-world data rather than abstract ideals. In the same spirit, Grounded Architecture evolves through continuous feedback, real usage, and tangible impact—not just best practices from outdated textbooks.</p>

<p>Throughout this book, I will share insights, tools, and stories to help you build an architecture practice that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Collaborative</strong>, not isolated</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptable</strong>, not rigid</li>
  <li><strong>Outcome-oriented</strong>, not obsessed with processes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re an architect, engineering leader, or technologist looking to make architecture more effective and human, this book offers a grounded path forward.</p>

<h2 id="grounded-architecture-overview">Grounded Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>This book introduces <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong>, a practical, people-centered approach to managing an IT architecture practice—especially in complex, fast-paced organizations. It is based on my experiences at <strong>AVIV Group</strong>, <strong>eBay Classifieds</strong>, and <strong>Adevinta</strong>, and is designed to help you overcome the stereotype of the <strong>“architect in the ivory tower.”</strong></p>

<p>Instead, this approach reimagines architecture as <strong>deeply embedded</strong>, <strong>collaborative</strong>, and <strong>realistic</strong>—firmly rooted in the needs of teams, data, and outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="two-main-parts">Two Main Parts</h3>

<p>The book is divided into two complementary sections (see <em>Figure 1</em>):</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Framework</strong> – The essential components that will enable you to build your own Grounded Architecture practice.</li>
  <li><strong>Guiding Principles</strong> – Practical insights, tips, and inspiration to help you apply the framework effectively and sustainably.</li>
</ol>

<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Grounded Architecture Overview</em></p>

<h3 id="the-grounded-architecture-framework">The Grounded Architecture Framework</h3>

<p>The framework consists of <strong>three core elements</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics (Data)</a></strong>: This element enables data-informed decisions by providing accurate, up-to-date insights into your organization’s technology landscape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks (People)</a></strong>: This emphasizes the power of relationships and peer networks to scale architectural influence and ensure shared ownership of key decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Operating Model</strong>: This offers the governance structures, principles, and practices that shape how architecture functions across the organization. This includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="operating-model">General Principles</a>:</strong> Aligning architecture with your organization’s reality by focusing on collaboration, autonomy, and strategic alignment rather than top-down control.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="governance">IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates</a>:</strong> Governance should be a <strong>balanced mix</strong> of soft influence (nudging), economic signals (taxes), and clear boundaries (mandates/bans).</li>
      <li><strong><a href="gen-ai">Leveraging Generative AI within Grounded Architecture Framework</a>:</strong> Based on my early explorations, this section shares practical ways to integrate GenAI tools into architectural workflows while maintaining integrity and oversight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These components together form a <strong>pragmatic, adaptive foundation</strong> for modern architectural practice—grounded in <strong>data, people, and results</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="guiding-principles-and-inspiration-books-2-and-3">Guiding Principles and Inspiration (Books 2 and 3)</h3>

<p>Before diving into the full framework, I would like to share some thoughts on <strong>why</strong> I wrote this book.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-you-learn">What Will You Learn?</h2>

<p>This book is a <strong>practical guide</strong> to building and managing a <strong>robust, modern IT architecture practice</strong>. It aims to help you align with organizational goals, navigate complexity, and thrive in today’s rapidly evolving IT environments.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a practicing architect, a leader of architects, or someone working closely with them, this book will provide you with <strong>insight, structure, and inspiration</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="key-topics">Key Topics</h3>

<p>You’ll discover useful perspectives and actionable advice on how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Create flexible organizational and technical structures</strong> that support and scale IT architecture work.</li>
  <li><strong>Define architecture roles, skills, and career paths</strong> to help your architects grow and succeed.</li>
  <li><strong>Operate an architecture practice effectively</strong> in diverse, complex, and multicultural environments.</li>
  <li>Learn from <strong>real-world lessons and insights</strong> based on my experiences at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="format--structure">Format &amp; Structure</h3>

<p>I’ve organized this book as a <strong>high-level “playbook”</strong> for running an architecture practice or working as an architect. Each section introduces a topic, offers <strong>concrete tips</strong>, and concludes with <strong>reflective questions</strong> to help you apply the ideas in your context.</p>

<p>You can read this book <strong>cover to cover</strong> or dip into it based on your current needs and interests. With rich <strong>illustrations</strong> and conceptual visuals, it also functions as a <strong>“coffee table book”</strong>—perfect for team discussions, sparking conversations, or flipping through for inspiration.</p>

<h3 id="what-this-book-is-not">What This Book Is <em>Not</em></h3>

<p>This book is <strong>not a technical manual</strong>. It does not discuss cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, database sharding, or performance optimization in depth. While these are essential skills, they are well-covered elsewhere.</p>

<p>Instead, this book broadens your <strong>architectural perspective</strong>, helping you apply your technical knowledge to <strong>complex organizational ecosystems</strong>. It’s written for both <strong>hands-on architects</strong> and those managing or supporting them.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-a-proven-method">Is This a Proven Method?</h3>

<p>This book isn’t a prescriptive methodology, nor is it scientifically validated. It is a <strong>personal and opinionated guide</strong>, grounded in day-to-day experience rather than academic theory.</p>

<p>What I present here has been tested across <strong>three major companies</strong>, and while every organization is different, I believe the principles are <strong>general enough to be reusable and practical enough to be valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>In a field filled with frameworks and formal models, <strong>real stories and tested approaches</strong> often provide the most valuable guidance. I also encourage others to share their experiences because our discipline becomes stronger through <strong>practical reflection and honest exchange</strong>, rather than abstract theory.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who Should Read This Book?</h3>

<p>This book is intended for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IT architects</strong> who want to enhance their impact, influence, and clarity.</li>
  <li><strong>Engineering leaders</strong> who manage architects and wish to organize their work more effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Business and product leaders</strong> looking to understand the value of architecture and how to collaborate better with technical teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>I designed it to be <strong>accessible to both technical and non-technical readers</strong>, and useful whether you’re building a practice from scratch or refining an existing one.</p>

<h3 id="applying-ideas-in-practice-architecture-as-cooking">Applying Ideas in Practice: Architecture as Cooking</h3>

<p>I like to think of starting or improving an architecture practice as a form of <strong>culinary art</strong>.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving at a new company like a chef stepping into an unfamiliar kitchen, carrying a suitcase filled with your favorite tools and spices. Your most important work comes next: discovering the <strong>local ingredients</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1409729992.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/Hispanolistic">Hispanolistic</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

<p>Great cooking depends on what’s fresh and available, but great architecture relies on <strong>your organization’s people, culture, and context</strong>. Your frameworks and experience provide structure, but the authentic flavor comes from your team: their skills, insights, and unique organizational knowledge.</p>

<p>While I’ll share recipes, methods, and even a few secret sauces, remember: <strong>you’ll always need to adapt to your local ingredients</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-rigid-frameworks-it-architecture-as-a-collaborative-adaptable-outcome-oriented-practice">Beyond Rigid Frameworks: IT Architecture as a Collaborative, Adaptable, Outcome-Oriented Practice</h2>

<p>In this book, I use the terms <strong>IT architecture</strong> and <strong>IT architects</strong> broadly and inclusively. I do not draw strict lines between enterprise, solution, technical, or software architecture, nor do I narrowly define titles such as enterprise architect, solution architect, or staff-level technical leaders like principal engineers.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1376008059.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Instead, I view IT architecture as a <strong>cohesive function</strong>—a bridge that connects technology, business, product, and organizational strategy. Architecture encompasses more than a set of tasks or responsibilities; it serves as the <strong>connective tissue</strong> that brings coherence to complex ecosystems, enabling various parts of the organization to work in harmony.</p>

<h3 id="grounding-and-empowerment">Grounding and Empowerment</h3>

<p>Rather than advocating for rigid distinctions between roles, I propose <strong>empowering architects with a data-informed, outcome-oriented mindset</strong>. In this approach, architectural roles are <strong>adaptable</strong>, evolving to meet the organization’s needs while remaining aligned to deliver meaningful value.</p>

<p><strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> refers to anchoring architectural work in the organization’s reality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grounded in <strong>data</strong> to inform decisions</li>
  <li>Grounded in <strong>people</strong> to foster collaboration and shared understanding</li>
  <li>Grounded in <strong>pragmatic operating models</strong> that guide action</li>
</ul>

<p>To adopt this approach, you do not need to restructure your teams or redefine every role. What matters most is <strong>how architects operate</strong>—as collaborators, connectors, and enablers of aligned outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="adaptability-over-rigidity">Adaptability Over Rigidity</h3>

<p>IT architecture is <strong>not one-size-fits-all</strong>. Its form and focus should adapt to the context of each company. In some organizations, the emphasis may be on <strong>business alignment</strong>—ensuring that technology investments directly support the mission. In others, the focus may be on <strong>technical depth</strong>—working closely with engineers to build scalable, secure, high-performing systems.</p>

<p>Regardless of emphasis, the <strong>core function remains the same</strong>: to bring coherence to complexity and alignment to decisions. Therefore, I define “architect” not by job title, but by function—anyone who bridges the gap between <strong>strategic intent and technical execution</strong> is an architect.</p>

<p>This adaptable perspective allows organizations to maximize the benefits of architecture while enabling architects to adjust their contributions based on what is most needed—strategy, integration, governance, or mentorship.</p>

<h3 id="accepting-the-challenges">Accepting the Challenges</h3>

<p>Of course, this broader and more flexible view brings <strong>new challenges</strong>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional frameworks, which have predefined roles, clear handoffs, and rigid responsibilities, the Grounded Architecture approach <strong>requires architects to adapt continuously</strong>. It values relevance over formality and responsiveness over structure.</p>

<p>This approach <strong>can be demanding</strong>.</p>

<p>It requires architects to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shift fluidly between <strong>strategic thinking and hands-on guidance</strong></li>
  <li>Engage regularly with <strong>diverse stakeholders</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Recalibrate their priorities</strong> as business needs evolve</li>
  <li>Make decisions amid <strong>ambiguity and uncertainty</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It also demands sound judgment—knowing <strong>when to lead, when to advise, and when to step back</strong>.</p>

<p>However, with these challenges come significant benefits.</p>

<p>Architects who embrace this approach are better equipped to respond to real-world needs. They help build solutions that are <strong>context-aware</strong>, <strong>collaborative</strong>, and <strong>aligned with long-term goals</strong>. They foster trust, promote innovation, and unlock value—not by controlling systems, but by guiding them with insight, empathy, and adaptability.</p>

<p>This book is a call to <strong>reimagine architecture as a living, collaborative, and responsive practice</strong>. One that moves beyond rigid frameworks and static organizational charts. One that values architectural success not in titles or artifacts, but in <strong>outcomes, alignment, and impact</strong>.</p>

<p>It may not always be the easiest path, but I believe it is the one most capable of delivering lasting value in complex, modern organizations.</p>

<h2 id="key-influences">Key Influences</h2>

<p>The <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> approach is shaped not only by my experiences but also by the work and ideas of others who have inspired and informed my thinking.</p>

<h3 id="the-architecture-elevator--gregor-hohpe">The Architecture Elevator — Gregor Hohpe</h3>

<p>One of the most influential voices behind this work is <strong>Gregor Hohpe</strong> and his concept of the <a href="https://architectelevator.com/"><strong>Architecture Elevator</strong></a>. Gregor provides a vivid illustration of the modern architect as someone who navigates between the <strong>“penthouse,” where strategy is developed</strong>, and the <strong>“engine room,” where technology is built</strong>.</p>

<p>His perspective of architects as enablers of alignment, friction reduction, and transformation strategy has been foundational to my practice of Grounded Architecture. Much of what I share in this book reflects the valuable lessons learned from <strong>applying Gregor’s ideas in real organizational contexts</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="staff-engineering--tanya-reilly--will-larson">Staff+ Engineering — Tanya Reilly &amp; Will Larson</h3>

<p>Another major influence has been the evolution of <strong>Staff+ engineering roles</strong>, which present a contemporary and practical view of technical leadership. Key texts such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/"><strong>The Staff Engineer’s Path</strong> by Tanya Reilly</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/"><strong>Staff Engineer</strong> by Will Larson</a></li>
</ul>

<p>…offer a clear and relatable framework for understanding <strong>what senior technical leadership entails outside of traditional management tracks</strong>. These models have significantly shaped my thoughts on the responsibilities, mindset, and career development of modern architects.</p>

<p>Staff+ engineers and architects often encounter similar challenges—balancing long-term vision with day-to-day decisions, influencing without authority, and collaborating across boundaries. The overlap between these roles is considerable, and these resources have informed my perspective on <strong>architectural maturity, influence, and impact</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="many-more-sources">Many More Sources</h3>

<p>Grounded Architecture is built on <strong>a broad foundation of books, frameworks, articles, and tools</strong>—too numerous to list in one place. I have collected and curated many of these resources in the online <a href="https://grounded-architecture.io/bookshelf"><strong>Bookshelf appendix</strong></a>, where you can explore what has influenced this work and perhaps find inspiration for your own journey.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-book">Why This Book?</h2>

<p>This book serves as a way to <strong>generalize and share years of experience</strong> as a practicing architect and architecture leader. It originated from a need to <strong>clarify my thinking</strong>, <strong>educate others</strong>, and <strong>create shareable resources</strong> that can help individuals and organizations better understand and apply modern architectural practices.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/writing.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Writing helped me refine my thinking, evolve tools and principles, and share lessons learned.</em></p>

<h3 id="writing-to-think">Writing to Think</h3>

<p>Writing forces clarity. As <strong>Gregor Hohpe</strong> once said, <em>“Every sentence you write frees up brain cells to learn new things.”</em> This was true for me as I began to shape my ideas into written form. Writing this book helped me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Organize my thoughts</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Identify gaps</strong> and contradictions in my approach</li>
  <li><strong>Enhance my frameworks and tools</strong></li>
  <li>Discover <strong>new insights</strong> through reflection</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-to-teach">Writing to Teach</h3>

<p>Another motivation was <strong>education</strong>—specifically, educating architects and technical leaders within the organizations I’ve worked for. I found that well-written, accessible material helps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Explain the “why” behind architecture</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Standardize terminology and mindset</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create alignment</strong> across teams and levels</li>
</ul>

<p>As Gregor Hohpe also points out, writing has several distinct advantages over spoken communication:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It scales</strong> — You don’t need to be present to reach your audience.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s faster</strong> — People read 2–3 times faster than they can listen.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s searchable and reusable</strong> — Readers can revisit it, quote it, and reference it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>written content makes architectural thinking more portable and enduring</strong>—ideal for spreading modern ideas across large, distributed organizations.</p>

<h3 id="writing-to-share-and-learn-more">Writing to Share (and Learn More)</h3>

<p>By documenting and refining my experiences, I hope to make this content <strong>valuable for others</strong>—whether they are facing similar challenges or are simply curious about evolving their architectural practice. I also look forward to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning from others’ feedback</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Comparing notes with peers</strong></li>
  <li>Continuing the conversation about <strong>what modern IT architecture can become</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This book is not a final answer; it’s a <strong>living reflection</strong> of one practitioner’s journey. My hope is that it sparks new insights, invites discussion, and helps architects—and those who work with them—develop more grounded, human, and effective practices.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-personal-history">A Bit of Personal History</h2>

<p>The ideas and practices presented in this book are based on <strong>years of hands-on experience</strong> across various roles, organizations, and industries. Each chapter of my career has contributed essential insights that form the foundation of the <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> approach.</p>

<h3 id="aviv-group-ebay-classifieds-and-adevinta">AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta</h3>

<p>Much of the work in this book stems from my current role as <strong>Chief Architect at AVIV Group</strong>, as well as my earlier positions as <strong>Principal Architect at eBay Classifieds</strong> and <strong>Adevinta</strong>. These experiences have enabled me to lead architectural practices in <strong>large, complex, and rapidly evolving organizations</strong>, skillfully balancing long-term strategy with everyday realities.</p>

<h3 id="software-improvement-group-sig">Software Improvement Group (SIG)</h3>

<p>In the earlier stages of my career, I was a <strong>consultant and analyst</strong> at the <a href="https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/"><strong>Software Improvement Group (SIG)</strong></a>, where I discovered the power of <strong>data-informed decision-making</strong>. This role taught me how to extract meaningful insights from systems and how invaluable these insights are for guiding architectural choices.</p>

<p>Building on that experience, I developed <a href="https://sokrates.dev"><strong>Sokrates</strong></a>, an open-source tool designed to extract data from source code repositories to visualize <strong>system complexity, team structures, and organizational dynamics</strong>. This work significantly influenced the <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> pillar of the Grounded Architecture framework.</p>

<h3 id="incision">Incision</h3>

<p>My tenure as <strong>CTO of <a href="https://incision.care">Incision</a></strong>, a healthcare startup, provided a direct view of the challenges in <strong>building and managing a technology organization</strong> from scratch. It was an intense, insightful, and humbling journey that deepened my understanding of architecture at the intersection of <strong>delivery, constraints, and leadership</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="research-in-design-and-systems-thinking">Research in Design and Systems Thinking</h3>

<p>Before entering the industry, I worked as a <strong>researcher</strong> at the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/"><strong>Dutch Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/"><strong>Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</strong></a>. This academic background equipped me with skills in <strong>rigorous data analysis, modeling, and research methods</strong>.</p>

<p>One project from that period that significantly shaped my perspective was <a href="https://design-instability.com/"><strong>Design Instability</strong></a>, a series of essays co-authored with <strong>Erik Stolterman</strong>. We explored the commonalities in <strong>architectural practices across disciplines</strong>, including classical design, UX design, and software engineering. This exploration helped me appreciate the <strong>value of cross-disciplinary thinking</strong>, a crucial skill for modern architects working at the intersection of technology, people, and business.</p>

<h3 id="developer-roots">Developer Roots</h3>

<p>Finally, I greatly value my early experience as a <strong>hands-on software developer</strong>. It’s important for architects to remain close to the code and to the developers who write it. This technical grounding has proven essential in all my subsequent roles.</p>

<p>Together, these experiences have shaped a practice that is <strong>data-informed, people-oriented, and grounded in real-world complexity</strong>. This book reflects those lessons—not as a theoretical model, but as a <strong>practitioner’s field guide</strong> for building architecture that truly works: <strong>inside real organizations, with real people, solving real problems</strong>.</p>

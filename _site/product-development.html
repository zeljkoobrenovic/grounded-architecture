<p><br />
Product development is creating and bringing <strong>new products or services to the market</strong>. It involves the entire journey from the <strong>conception</strong> of an idea to the product’s final <strong>development</strong>, <strong>marketing</strong>, and <strong>distribution</strong>. Product development encompasses various activities and stages to transform an initial concept into a tangible and market-ready offering.</p>

<p>When it comes to product development, I generally recommend two resources for architects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42611483-escaping-the-build-trap">Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value</a>” by Melissa Perri, and</li>
  <li>“<a href="https://hbr.org/1993/01/customer-intimacy-and-other-value-disciplines">The Discipline of Market Leader</a>”, by Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these sources provide three things for architects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase their awareness</strong> about how good or bad product development looks like,</li>
  <li>Provide them with tools to <strong>challenge product decisions</strong>, and</li>
  <li>Prepare them for <strong>designing</strong> the organization’s systems that suit <strong>diverse product strategies</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-build-trap">The Build Trap</h2>

<p>The Escaping the Build Trap book is a guide intended to help organizations <strong>shift their focus</strong> from simply <strong>building and shipping</strong> products to <strong>creating value</strong> for their customers. The “build trap” refers to the common pitfall where companies become fixated on building more features and products without considering whether they meet customer needs or generate desired outcomes.</p>

<p>Perri explores the reasons behind the build trap and provides practical strategies to help businesses escape it by adopting a <strong>value-centric, customer-focused approach</strong>. The main message is that by understanding customer needs, adopting a customer-centric approach, and <strong>embracing innovation and agility</strong>, companies can increase their chances of developing successful products that stand out in the market.</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to numerous insights for architects, the book provides the following valuable tips necessary for architects’ good interaction with product development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know how <strong>a good product development</strong> process looks like</li>
  <li>Recognizing <strong>bad product-development</strong> approaches</li>
  <li>Recognizing <strong>bad product manager</strong> archetypes</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="how-a-good-product-development-approach-looks-like">How a Good Product Development Approach Looks Like</h3>

<p>Product-led companies understand that the success of their products is the primary <strong>driver of growth and value for their company</strong>. They prioritize, organize, and strategize around product success.</p>

<p>Critical elements of successful product-led companies include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understanding Customer Needs</strong>: Successful companies understand customer needs, desires, and expectations to develop successful products. Businesses can gain valuable insights and tailor their products by conducting thorough market research and engaging with customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adopting a Customer-Centric Approach</strong>: Organizations need to adopt a customer-centric approach to product development to avoid the build trap. This approach means prioritizing customer satisfaction and incorporating their feedback throughout the entire product development process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Executing Iterative Product Development</strong>: Iterative product development is essential, continuously testing and refining the product based on customer feedback. An iterative process helps businesses identify and address potential issues before they become significant problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Aligning Business Goals with Customer Needs</strong>: Businesses should align their goals and objectives with the needs of their customers. Doing so can ensure their products deliver value and create a robust and loyal customer base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embracing Innovation and Agility</strong>: Businesses must be innovative and agile to adapt to rapidly changing customer preferences and market conditions. This adaptivity includes staying informed about the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in product development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Measuring Success</strong>: Accurately measuring a product’s success is essential. Such measuring involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and using data-driven insights to make informed product improvements and enhancements decisions (Figure 1).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Architects should be familiar with these characteristics, helping their product leads to operate an effective product development.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/product-metrics.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Some of typical product metrics.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="bad-product-companies-archetypes">Bad Product Companies Archetypes</h3>

<p>The build trap occurs when businesses focus too much on their product’s features and functionalities, overlooking customers’ needs and preferences. Value, from a business perspective, is pretty straightforward. It can fuel your business: <strong>money, data, knowledge capital, or promotion</strong>. Every feature you build and any initiative you take as a company should result in some outcome that is tied back to that business value.</p>

<p>Many companies are, instead, led by sales, visionaries, or technology. All of these ways of organizing can land you in the build trap.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Sales-led companies</strong> let their contracts define their product strategy. The product roadmap and direction were driven by what was promised to customers without aligning with the overall strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Visionary-led companies</strong> can be compelling — when you have the right visionary. Also, when that visionary leaves, the product direction usually crumbles. Operating as a visionary-led company is not sustainable.</li>
  <li><strong>The technology-led companies</strong> are driven by the latest and coolest technology. The problem is that they often lack a market-facing, value-led strategy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Architects should be able to recognize and frequently challenge organizations with these archetypes.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="bad-product-manager-archetypes">Bad Product Manager Archetypes</h3>

<p>Architects will frequently need to collaborate closely with product managers. The fundamental role of the product manager in the organization is to work with a team to create the right product that <strong>balances meeting business needs with solving user problems</strong>. Product managers connect the dots. They take input from customer research, expert information, market research, business direction, experiment results, and data analysis.</p>

<p>To better understand the role of a product manager, it is helpful to understand three bad product manager archetypes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Mini-CEO:</strong> Product managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product, yet most job postings for product managers describe them as the mini-CEO. CEOs have sole authority over many things. Product managers can’t change many things a CEO can do in an organization. They especially don’t have power over people because they are not people managers at the team level. Instead, they must influence them to move in a specific direction. Out of this CEO myth emerged an archetype of a very <strong>arrogant product manager</strong> who thinks they rule the world.</li>
  <li><strong>The Former Project Manager</strong>: Product managers are not project managers, although some project management is needed to execute the role correctly. <strong>Project managers are responsible for the when</strong>. When will a project finish? Is everyone on track? Will we hit our deadline? <strong>Product managers are responsible for the why.</strong> Why are we building this? How does it deliver value to our customers? How does it help meet the goals of the business? The latter questions are more challenging to answer than the former, and product managers who don’t understand their roles often resort to doing that type of work. Many companies still think the project manager and product manager are the same.</li>
  <li><strong>The Waiter:</strong> The waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is <strong>an order taker</strong>. They go to their stakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those desires into a list of items to be developed. There is <strong>no goal, vision, or decision-making</strong> involved. More often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized. Instead of discovering problems, waiters ask, “What do you want?” The customer asks for a specific solution, which these product managers implement. The waiter approach leads to what David J. Bland is calling the <a href="https://twitter.com/davidjbland/status/467096015318036480">Product Death Cycle</a>:</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-discipline-of-market-leader">The Discipline of Market Leader</h2>

<p>Another tool I found helpful in my work as an architect is <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/1993/01/customer-intimacy-and-other-value-disciplines">The Discipline of Market Leader</a></strong>, a concept developed by Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema. The Discipline of Market Leader highlights a company’s three strategic paths to achieve market leadership: <strong>operational excellence</strong>, <strong>product leadership</strong>, and <strong>customer intimacy</strong> (Figure 2). The model postulates that any successful business needs to maintain at least “acceptable” performance levels in each of the three dimensions but would need to <strong>choose one of them to become a market leader</strong> in its field. The model suggests that if you genuinely want to excel in any of the three disciplines, you must make <strong>sacrifices in the other two</strong> as these become mutually exclusive.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/discipline-market-leader.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The Discipline of Market Leader model postulates that any successful business needs to maintain at least “acceptable” levels of performance in each of the three dimensions (operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy) but would need to choose one of them to become a market leader in its field.</em></p>

<p>I found the model helpful in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To challenge <strong>plans and strategies that are too ambitious</strong>, e.g., wanting to excel in all three directions: operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy. It is very complex and expensive to try to build a scalable solution accessible by many users and from many countries while addressing the particular needs of one local customer while doing significant work to innovate around the latest technology hype.</li>
  <li>To prepare for <strong>architecting the company’s IT landscape</strong>, as different directions require different approaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each direction represents a unique value proposition and requires specific architectural considerations to support it effectively.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operational Excellence:</strong> This path focuses on delivering products or services at the lowest cost and highest efficiency. The IT architecture should <strong>streamline processes, automate repetitive tasks, and optimize resource allocation</strong>. It involves leveraging technologies like enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, supply chain management tools, and process automation solutions to achieve operational efficiency. <strong>Scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness</strong> are critical factors in architectural design.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Leadership:</strong> This path involves developing and delivering innovative and superior products or services that differentiate an organization from its competitors. The IT architecture should prioritize <strong>flexibility, agility, and the ability to support rapid innovation</strong>. Architecture typically emphasizes integrating product development and research systems, <strong>data analytics</strong> capabilities, and <strong>collaboration tools</strong> to facilitate idea generation, prototyping, and testing. Ensure that the architecture enables seamless integration with external partners and suppliers to foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Intimacy:</strong> This path focuses on building <strong>strong customer relationships</strong> and delivering <strong>personalized experiences</strong>. The IT architecture should enable customer data collection, analysis, and utilization to gain insights and provide customized solutions. Architectural considerations frequently include complex customer relationship management (CRM) systems, data analytics platforms, and customer engagement tools. Integration with various touchpoints, such as web portals, mobile applications, and social media channels, is essential to deliver a seamless and personalized customer experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Incorporating the Discipline of Market Leader into IT architecture design requires <strong>aligning technology choices and design decisions with the chosen strategic path</strong>. Additionally, the architecture should be flexible enough to adapt to evolving market dynamics and business needs, allowing the organization to switch or combine strategic routes if required.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the Discipline of Market Leader is <strong>not a one-size-fits-all</strong> approach, and organizations may need to balance elements from multiple paths based on their specific business context and market conditions.</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Have you ever found yourself or your organization falling into the “build trap”? What were the signs?</em></li>
  <li><em>Reflecting on your organization, would you say it’s sales-led, visionary-led, or technology-led?</em></li>
  <li><em>Can you identify instances where a product manager has acted like a “Mini-CEO,” “Waiter,” or a “Former Project Manager”? What were the consequences?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does your organization currently understand and incorporate customer needs? Could there be improvements in this area?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does your company approach iterative product development?</em></li>
  <li><em>Are your business goals aligned with customer needs? How do you maintain this alignment as business goals and customer needs evolve?</em></li>
  <li><em>How innovative and agile do you consider your organization to be? What areas need more flexibility or creativity?</em></li>
  <li><em>What metrics does your organization use to measure product success?</em></li>
  <li><em>Which of the three strategic paths (operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy) does your company or project currently emphasize most? Why?</em></li>

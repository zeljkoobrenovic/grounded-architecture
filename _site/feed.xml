  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="context-fast-moving-global-organizations">Context: Fast-Moving Global Organizations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>To better understand any idea or solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which this idea developed.</li>
    <li>The Grounded Architecture approach has evolved in the context of global, loosely coupled organizations that are diverse, with nonlinear growth dynamics, and under transformation pressures.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="goals-adapting-growing-and-using-data">Goals: Adapting, Growing, and Using Data</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I identified the following needs that an architecture practice should support: Executing At Scale, Adaptivity, Improving the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, and Maximizing Organizational Alignment &amp; Learning.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="grounded-architecture-framework">Grounded Architecture Framework</h2>

<h3 id="lightweight-architectural-analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Lightweight Architectural Analytics serves as a medium to create a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of the organization’s technology landscapes.</li>
    <li>Such analytics provides an architecture-centric view of data about a technology landscape based on source code analyses, public cloud billing reports, vibrancy reports, or incident tickets.</li>
    <li>To facilitate the creation of Lightweight Architectural Analytics, I have been creating open-source tools that can help you obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories. Check out open-source <a href="https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/grounded-architecture-dashboard-examples/">architecture dashboard examples</a> and <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="collaborative-networks">Collaborative Networks</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Developing an architecture practice requires having competent, empowered, and motivated architects. An an architecture practice must carefully organize, empower, and leverage scarce talent.</li>
    <li>In my work in the past few years, I combined two teams of architects: a small central architecture team and a cross-organizational distributed virtual team.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="operating-model-general-principles">Operating Model: General Principles</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The Operating Model is a system of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.</li>
    <li>Examples of activities include: supporting teams in their daily work; tracking tech debt; performing technical due diligence; standardizing processes and documentation; defining cloud, data, and platform strategies.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="cooperation-based-operating-model-six-simple-rules">Cooperation-Based Operating Model: Six Simple Rules</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes that in today’s complicated business environment, you must set up organizational structures based on cooperation.</li>
    <li>To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating.</li>
    <li>This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="operating-model-nudge-taxation-mandates">Operating Model: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Architecture practice should support governance models adaptable to organizations’ complex and diverse needs. A technology governance model should be a well-balanced hybrid of three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.</li>
    <li>Nudging is a form of governing where you create subtle or indirect suggestions influencing someone’s behavior or decision-making without forcing them or limiting their freedom of choice.</li>
    <li>Governing with taxes (economic incentives) is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to “pay” some form of taxes on used resources.</li>
    <li>With mandates and bans, you guide people by explicitly defining what they should or should not do.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="transforming-organizations-with-grounded-architecture">Transforming Organizations with Grounded Architecture</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>When a Grounded Architecture framework is in place, it can positively transform an organization’s functioning.</li>
    <li>These impact categories are Executing At Scale, Improving the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, Maximizing Organizational Alignment &amp; Learning, and Higher Adaptivity.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-being-architect">On Being Architect</h2>

<h3 id="building-skills">Building Skills</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>An architect’s typical skillset includes hard (technical) skills, soft (people &amp; social) skills, product development, business skills, and decision-making skills.</li>
    <li>Hard (technical) skills are essential for designing, implementing, and maintaining an organization’s technology landscape.</li>
    <li>Soft skills are integral to social architecture, enabling individuals to navigate and contribute to these social systems effectively.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="making-impact">Making Impact</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Architects’ work is evaluated based on their impact on the organization.</li>
    <li>Architects can make an impact via three pillars: Big-Picture Thinking, Execution, and Leveling-Up.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="leadership-traits">Leadership Traits</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet’s work and Netflix’s valued behaviors.</li>
    <li>Marquet focused on leadership and organizational management, particularly emphasizing the principles of Intent-Based Leadership.</li>
    <li>Borrowing from Netflix’s original values, I see the following behavioral traits as crucial for architects: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="thinking-like-an-architect-architects-as-superglue">Thinking Like an Architect: Architects as Superglue</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.</li>
    <li>Architects need to be technically strong. But their unique strengths should stem from being able to relate technical issues with business and broader issues.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="balancing-curiosity-doubt-vision-and-skepticism">Balancing Curiosity, Doubt, Vision, and Skepticism</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Curiosity and wonder</strong> spark exploration, leading to technological breakthroughs. However, without caution, it can result in premature adoption of immature solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Doubt</strong> forces a critical evaluation of progress, ensuring that innovative ideas are grounded in practical and validated approaches. Over-reliance on doubt can stifle risk-taking and hinder breakthrough innovation.</li>
    <li><strong>Vision and belief</strong> provide a long-term perspective, guiding efforts toward significant, transformative goals. Yet unchecked vision can lead to confirmation bias or misdirected resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Skepticism</strong> helps prevent overcommitment to unproven ideas, ensuring teams remain grounded. However, excessive skepticism can result in missed opportunities and discourage creative risk-taking.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="architects-career-paths">Architects’ Career Paths</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>A strong engineering background is essential for architects to make informed technology decisions and build effective relationships with developer teams.</li>
    <li>Moving from an engineering role to an architecture role involves broadening scope, increasing diversity, and developing strong communication and influencer skills.</li>
    <li>Career tracks can include Senior Architects (broader responsibilities), Principal Architects (specialized focus), and Enterprise Architects (aligning technical strategy with business objectives).</li>
    <li>Architecture roles can lead to tech leadership positions such as Engineering Director or Chief Technology Officer (CTO), leveraging strategic vision, decision-making, and leadership skills.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="on-human-complexity">On Human Complexity</h2>

<h3 id="the-culture-map-architects-culture-compass">The Culture Map: Architects’ Culture Compass</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a beneficial tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from various cultures and backgrounds.</li>
    <li>Meyer’s model contains eight scales, each representing a key area, showing how cultures vary from extreme to extreme: Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-human-side-of-decision-making">The Human Side of Decision-Making</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Decision-making is a human activity subject to human biases and limitations.</li>
    <li>Fundamental biases influencing decision-making include outcome, hindsight, and confirmation biases.</li>
    <li>Human intuition plays a vital role in decision-making.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="effortless-architecture">Effortless Architecture</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Greg McKeown’s “Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most” advocates for a paradigm shift from hard work to smart, effective work by simplifying tasks and processes.</li>

    <li>Business strategy and IT must align dynamically, with IT enabling execution through innovation, efficiency, and data-driven decisions.</li>
    <li>Enterprise Architecture frameworks emphasize operating models, flexibility (global vs. local), and stages of IT alignment from silos to modularity.</li>
    <li>Companies succeed by excelling in one strategic path—operational excellence, product leadership, or customer intimacy—supported by tailored IT architecture.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="architecture-in-product-led-organizations-learning-from-customer-centric-fields">Architecture in Product-Led Organizations: Learning From Customer-Centric Fields</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>When it comes to product development, I generally recommend two resources for architects: “Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value” by Melissa Perri and “Product Operations” by Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles.</li>
    <li>The build trap occurs when businesses focus too much on their product’s features and functionalities, overlooking customers’ needs and preferences.</li>
    <li>Product Operations is the discipline of helping product management scales well, surrounding teams with essential inputs to set strategy, prioritize, and streamline ways of working.</li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Architects are frequently asked about the (economic) value of architecture or technology investments.</li>
    <li>Answering this question is a crucial skill for any senior architect. However, answering it concisely and convincingly to a non-technical audience may be difficult.</li>
    <li>Borrowing from existing literature, I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of architecture: the return on investment metaphor and the selling options metaphor.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-big-transformations-get-done-learning-from-mega-projects">How Big Transformations Get Done: Learning From Mega-Projects</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>IT transformation projects are large-scale, multi-year endeavors that often aim for significant organizational changes, such as creating unified IT platforms after mergers, and they frequently face challenges similar to other mega-projects.</li>
    <li>Common cognitive biases and decision-making fallacies like overconfidence, strategic misrepresentation, and the sunk cost fallacy often derail these projects, leading to cost overruns, delays, and underperformance.</li>
    <li>Flyvbjerg and Gardner’s book “How Big Things Get Done” highlights lessons from successful and failed mega-projects across various industries, offering 11 practical heuristics for improving project leadership, including hiring the right experts, building modular systems, and focusing on risk mitigation.</li>

<p><br />
Have you ever wondered how to run an IT architecture practice without <strong>feeling isolated in an ivory tower</strong>, detached from your organization’s people, problems, and realities?</p>

<p>If so, this book is for you.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta, I introduce an approach I call <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong>. This <strong>practical, human-centered method</strong> emphasizes connecting to real-world challenges, real-time data, and real people.</p>

<p>Grounded Architecture is about <strong>keeping your feet on the ground</strong> rather than floating above the fray. It focuses on <strong>making architecture relevant, collaborative, and responsive</strong> to our fast-paced environments. It redefines architecture not as a set of abstract frameworks but as a living, evolving discipline rooted in relationships, results, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>In too many organizations, architects are viewed as distant wizards casting spells from a tower—producing documents no one reads and models no one uses. Grounded Architecture challenges that perception by <strong>promoting an architecture practice embedded in the organization’s fabric</strong>, which is connected to strategy, delivery, operations, and, most importantly, people.</p>

<p>This approach places data and collaboration at the center rather than relying on heavy-handed processes or over-engineered tools. It <strong>draws inspiration from Grounded Theory</strong>, a research methodology that develops theories from real-world data rather than abstract ideals. In the same spirit, Grounded Architecture evolves through continuous feedback, real usage, and tangible impact—not just best practices from outdated textbooks.</p>

<p>Throughout this book, I will share insights, tools, and stories to help you build an architecture practice that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Collaborative</strong>, not isolated</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptable</strong>, not rigid</li>
  <li><strong>Outcome-oriented</strong>, not obsessed with processes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re an architect, engineering leader, or technologist looking to make architecture more effective and human, this book offers a grounded path forward.</p>

<h2 id="grounded-architecture-overview">Grounded Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>This book introduces <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong>, a practical, people-centered approach to managing an IT architecture practice—especially in complex, fast-paced organizations. It is based on my experiences at <strong>AVIV Group</strong>, <strong>eBay Classifieds</strong>, and <strong>Adevinta</strong>, and is designed to help you overcome the stereotype of the <strong>“architect in the ivory tower.”</strong></p>

<p>Instead, this approach reimagines architecture as <strong>deeply embedded</strong>, <strong>collaborative</strong>, and <strong>realistic</strong>—firmly rooted in the needs of teams, data, and outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="two-main-parts">Two Main Parts</h3>

<p>The book is divided into two complementary sections (see <em>Figure 1</em>):</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Framework</strong> – The essential components that will enable you to build your own Grounded Architecture practice.</li>
  <li><strong>Guiding Principles</strong> – Practical insights, tips, and inspiration to help you apply the framework effectively and sustainably.</li>
</ol>

<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Grounded Architecture Overview</em></p>

<h3 id="the-grounded-architecture-framework">The Grounded Architecture Framework</h3>

<p>The framework consists of <strong>three core elements</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics (Data)</a></strong>: This element enables data-informed decisions by providing accurate, up-to-date insights into your organization’s technology landscape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks (People)</a></strong>: This emphasizes the power of relationships and peer networks to scale architectural influence and ensure shared ownership of key decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Operating Model</strong>: This offers the governance structures, principles, and practices that shape how architecture functions across the organization. This includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="operating-model">General Principles</a>:</strong> Aligning architecture with your organization’s reality by focusing on collaboration, autonomy, and strategic alignment rather than top-down control.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="six-simple-rules">Cooperation-Based Operating Model</a>:</strong> Inspired by <em>Six Simple Rules</em> (Morieux &amp; Tollman), this model encourages shared accountability and flexible structures to navigate complexity.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="governance">IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates</a>:</strong> Governance should be a <strong>balanced mix</strong> of soft influence (nudging), economic signals (taxes), and clear boundaries (mandates/bans).</li>
      <li><strong><a href="gen-ai-potential">Generative AI in Grounded Architecture</a>:</strong> Based on my early explorations, this section shares practical ways to integrate GenAI tools into architectural workflows while maintaining integrity and oversight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These components together form a <strong>pragmatic, adaptive foundation</strong> for modern architectural practice—grounded in <strong>data, people, and results</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="guiding-principles-and-inspiration-books-2-and-3">Guiding Principles and Inspiration (Books 2 and 3)</h3>

<p>You can read this book <strong>cover to cover</strong> or dip into it based on your current needs and interests. With rich <strong>illustrations</strong> and conceptual visuals, it also functions as a <strong>“coffee table book”</strong>—perfect for team discussions, sparking conversations, or flipping through for inspiration.</p>

<h3 id="what-this-book-is-not">What This Book Is <em>Not</em></h3>

<p>This book is <strong>not a technical manual</strong>. It does not discuss cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, database sharding, or performance optimization in depth. While these are essential skills, they are well-covered elsewhere.</p>

<p>Instead, this book broadens your <strong>architectural perspective</strong>, helping you apply your technical knowledge to <strong>complex organizational ecosystems</strong>. It’s written for both <strong>hands-on architects</strong> and those managing or supporting them.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-a-proven-method">Is This a Proven Method?</h3>

<p>This book isn’t a prescriptive methodology, nor is it scientifically validated. It is a <strong>personal and opinionated guide</strong>, grounded in day-to-day experience rather than academic theory.</p>

<p>What I present here has been tested across <strong>three major companies</strong>, and while every organization is different, I believe the principles are <strong>general enough to be reusable and practical enough to be valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>In a field filled with frameworks and formal models, <strong>real stories and tested approaches</strong> often provide the most valuable guidance. I also encourage others to share their experiences because our discipline becomes stronger through <strong>practical reflection and honest exchange</strong>, rather than abstract theory.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who Should Read This Book?</h3>

<p>This book is intended for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IT architects</strong> who want to enhance their impact, influence, and clarity.</li>
  <li><strong>Engineering leaders</strong> who manage architects and wish to organize their work more effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Business and product leaders</strong> looking to understand the value of architecture and how to collaborate better with technical teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>I designed it to be <strong>accessible to both technical and non-technical readers</strong>, and useful whether you’re building a practice from scratch or refining an existing one.</p>

<h3 id="applying-ideas-in-practice-architecture-as-cooking">Applying Ideas in Practice: Architecture as Cooking</h3>

<p>I like to think of starting or improving an architecture practice as a form of <strong>culinary art</strong>.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving at a new company like a chef stepping into an unfamiliar kitchen, carrying a suitcase filled with your favorite tools and spices. Your most important work comes next: discovering the <strong>local ingredients</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1409729992.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Great cooking depends on what’s fresh and available, but great architecture relies on <strong>your organization’s people, culture, and context</strong>. Your frameworks and experience provide structure, but the authentic flavor comes from your team: their skills, insights, and unique organizational knowledge.</p>

<p>While I’ll share recipes, methods, and even a few secret sauces, remember: <strong>you’ll always need to adapt to your local ingredients</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-rigid-frameworks-it-architecture-as-a-collaborative-adaptable-outcome-oriented-practice">Beyond Rigid Frameworks: IT Architecture as a Collaborative, Adaptable, Outcome-Oriented Practice</h2>

<p>In this book, I use the terms <strong>IT architecture</strong> and <strong>IT architects</strong> broadly and inclusively. I do not draw strict lines between enterprise, solution, technical, or software architecture, nor do I narrowly define titles such as enterprise architect, solution architect, or staff-level technical leaders like principal engineers.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1376008059.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Instead, I view IT architecture as a <strong>cohesive function</strong>—a bridge that connects technology, business, product, and organizational strategy. Architecture encompasses more than a set of tasks or responsibilities; it serves as the <strong>connective tissue</strong> that brings coherence to complex ecosystems, enabling various parts of the organization to work in harmony.</p>

<h3 id="grounding-and-empowerment">Grounding and Empowerment</h3>

<p>Rather than advocating for rigid distinctions between roles, I propose <strong>empowering architects with a data-informed, outcome-oriented mindset</strong>. In this approach, architectural roles are <strong>adaptable</strong>, evolving to meet the organization’s needs while remaining aligned to deliver meaningful value.</p>

<p><strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> refers to anchoring architectural work in the organization’s reality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grounded in <strong>data</strong> to inform decisions</li>
  <li>Grounded in <strong>people</strong> to foster collaboration and shared understanding</li>
  <li>Grounded in <strong>pragmatic operating models</strong> that guide action</li>
</ul>

<p>To adopt this approach, you do not need to restructure your teams or redefine every role. What matters most is <strong>how architects operate</strong>—as collaborators, connectors, and enablers of aligned outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="adaptability-over-rigidity">Adaptability Over Rigidity</h3>

<p>IT architecture is <strong>not one-size-fits-all</strong>. Its form and focus should adapt to the context of each company. In some organizations, the emphasis may be on <strong>business alignment</strong>—ensuring that technology investments directly support the mission. In others, the focus may be on <strong>technical depth</strong>—working closely with engineers to build scalable, secure, high-performing systems.</p>

<p>Regardless of emphasis, the <strong>core function remains the same</strong>: to bring coherence to complexity and alignment to decisions. Therefore, I define “architect” not by job title, but by function—anyone who bridges the gap between <strong>strategic intent and technical execution</strong> is an architect.</p>

<p>This adaptable perspective allows organizations to maximize the benefits of architecture while enabling architects to adjust their contributions based on what is most needed—strategy, integration, governance, or mentorship.</p>

<h3 id="accepting-the-challenges">Accepting the Challenges</h3>

<p>Of course, this broader and more flexible view brings <strong>new challenges</strong>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional frameworks, which have predefined roles, clear handoffs, and rigid responsibilities, the Grounded Architecture approach <strong>requires architects to adapt continuously</strong>. It values relevance over formality and responsiveness over structure.</p>

<p>This approach <strong>can be demanding</strong>.</p>

<p>It requires architects to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shift fluidly between <strong>strategic thinking and hands-on guidance</strong></li>
  <li>Engage regularly with <strong>diverse stakeholders</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Recalibrate their priorities</strong> as business needs evolve</li>
  <li>Make decisions amid <strong>ambiguity and uncertainty</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It also demands sound judgment—knowing <strong>when to lead, when to advise, and when to step back</strong>.</p>

<p>However, with these challenges come significant benefits.</p>

<p>Architects who embrace this approach are better equipped to respond to real-world needs. They help build solutions that are <strong>context-aware</strong>, <strong>collaborative</strong>, and <strong>aligned with long-term goals</strong>. They foster trust, promote innovation, and unlock value—not by controlling systems, but by guiding them with insight, empathy, and adaptability.</p>

<p>This book is a call to <strong>reimagine architecture as a living, collaborative, and responsive practice</strong>. One that moves beyond rigid frameworks and static organizational charts. One that values architectural success not in titles or artifacts, but in <strong>outcomes, alignment, and impact</strong>.</p>

<p>It may not always be the easiest path, but I believe it is the one most capable of delivering lasting value in complex, modern organizations.</p>

<h2 id="key-influences">Key Influences</h2>

<p>The <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> approach is shaped not only by my experiences but also by the work and ideas of others who have inspired and informed my thinking.</p>

<h3 id="the-architecture-elevator--gregor-hohpe">The Architecture Elevator — Gregor Hohpe</h3>

<p>One of the most influential voices behind this work is <strong>Gregor Hohpe</strong> and his concept of the <a href="https://architectelevator.com/"><strong>Architecture Elevator</strong></a>. Gregor provides a vivid illustration of the modern architect as someone who navigates between the <strong>“penthouse,” where strategy is developed</strong>, and the <strong>“engine room,” where technology is built</strong>.</p>

<p>His perspective of architects as enablers of alignment, friction reduction, and transformation strategy has been foundational to my practice of Grounded Architecture. Much of what I share in this book reflects the valuable lessons learned from <strong>applying Gregor’s ideas in real organizational contexts</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="staff-engineering--tanya-reilly--will-larson">Staff+ Engineering — Tanya Reilly &amp; Will Larson</h3>

<p>Another major influence has been the evolution of <strong>Staff+ engineering roles</strong>, which present a contemporary and practical view of technical leadership. Key texts such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/"><strong>The Staff Engineer’s Path</strong> by Tanya Reilly</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/"><strong>Staff Engineer</strong> by Will Larson</a></li>
</ul>

<p>…offer a clear and relatable framework for understanding <strong>what senior technical leadership entails outside of traditional management tracks</strong>. These models have significantly shaped my thoughts on the responsibilities, mindset, and career development of modern architects.</p>

<p>Staff+ engineers and architects often encounter similar challenges—balancing long-term vision with day-to-day decisions, influencing without authority, and collaborating across boundaries. The overlap between these roles is considerable, and these resources have informed my perspective on <strong>architectural maturity, influence, and impact</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="many-more-sources">Many More Sources</h3>

<p>Grounded Architecture is built on <strong>a broad foundation of books, frameworks, articles, and tools</strong>—too numerous to list in one place. I have collected and curated many of these resources in the online <a href="https://grounded-architecture.io/bookshelf"><strong>Bookshelf appendix</strong></a>, where you can explore what has influenced this work and perhaps find inspiration for your own journey.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-book">Why This Book?</h2>

<p>This book serves as a way to <strong>generalize and share years of experience</strong> as a practicing architect and architecture leader. It originated from a need to <strong>clarify my thinking</strong>, <strong>educate others</strong>, and <strong>create shareable resources</strong> that can help individuals and organizations better understand and apply modern architectural practices.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/writing.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Writing helped me refine my thinking, evolve tools and principles, and share lessons learned.</em></p>

<h3 id="writing-to-think">Writing to Think</h3>

<p>Writing forces clarity. As <strong>Gregor Hohpe</strong> once said, <em>“Every sentence you write frees up brain cells to learn new things.”</em> This was true for me as I began to shape my ideas into written form. Writing this book helped me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Organize my thoughts</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Identify gaps</strong> and contradictions in my approach</li>
  <li><strong>Enhance my frameworks and tools</strong></li>
  <li>Discover <strong>new insights</strong> through reflection</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-to-teach">Writing to Teach</h3>

<p>Another motivation was <strong>education</strong>—specifically, educating architects and technical leaders within the organizations I’ve worked for. I found that well-written, accessible material helps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Explain the “why” behind architecture</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Standardize terminology and mindset</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create alignment</strong> across teams and levels</li>
</ul>

<p>As Gregor Hohpe also points out, writing has several distinct advantages over spoken communication:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It scales</strong> — You don’t need to be present to reach your audience.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s faster</strong> — People read 2–3 times faster than they can listen.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s searchable and reusable</strong> — Readers can revisit it, quote it, and reference it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>written content makes architectural thinking more portable and enduring</strong>—ideal for spreading modern ideas across large, distributed organizations.</p>

<h3 id="writing-to-share-and-learn-more">Writing to Share (and Learn More)</h3>

<p>By documenting and refining my experiences, I hope to make this content <strong>valuable for others</strong>—whether they are facing similar challenges or are simply curious about evolving their architectural practice. I also look forward to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning from others’ feedback</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Comparing notes with peers</strong></li>
  <li>Continuing the conversation about <strong>what modern IT architecture can become</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This book is not a final answer; it’s a <strong>living reflection</strong> of one practitioner’s journey. My hope is that it sparks new insights, invites discussion, and helps architects—and those who work with them—develop more grounded, human, and effective practices.</p>

<h2 id="a-part-of-the-bigger-picture-a-trilogy-in-four-parts">A Part of the Bigger Picture: A Trilogy in Four Parts</h2>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-personal-history">A Bit of Personal History</h2>

<p>The ideas and practices presented in this book are based on <strong>years of hands-on experience</strong> across various roles, organizations, and industries. Each chapter of my career has contributed essential insights that form the foundation of the <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> approach.</p>

<h3 id="aviv-group-ebay-classifieds-and-adevinta">AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta</h3>

<p>Much of the work in this book stems from my current role as <strong>Chief Architect at AVIV Group</strong>, as well as my earlier positions as <strong>Principal Architect at eBay Classifieds</strong> and <strong>Adevinta</strong>. These experiences have enabled me to lead architectural practices in <strong>large, complex, and rapidly evolving organizations</strong>, skillfully balancing long-term strategy with everyday realities.</p>

<h3 id="software-improvement-group-sig">Software Improvement Group (SIG)</h3>

<p>In the earlier stages of my career, I was a <strong>consultant and analyst</strong> at the <a href="https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/"><strong>Software Improvement Group (SIG)</strong></a>, where I discovered the power of <strong>data-informed decision-making</strong>. This role taught me how to extract meaningful insights from systems and how invaluable these insights are for guiding architectural choices.</p>

<p>Building on that experience, I developed <a href="https://sokrates.dev"><strong>Sokrates</strong></a>, an open-source tool designed to extract data from source code repositories to visualize <strong>system complexity, team structures, and organizational dynamics</strong>. This work significantly influenced the <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> pillar of the Grounded Architecture framework.</p>

<h3 id="incision">Incision</h3>

<p>My tenure as <strong>CTO of <a href="https://incision.care">Incision</a></strong>, a healthcare startup, provided a direct view of the challenges in <strong>building and managing a technology organization</strong> from scratch. It was an intense, insightful, and humbling journey that deepened my understanding of architecture at the intersection of <strong>delivery, constraints, and leadership</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="research-in-design-and-systems-thinking">Research in Design and Systems Thinking</h3>

<p>Before entering the industry, I worked as a <strong>researcher</strong> at the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/"><strong>Dutch Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/"><strong>Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</strong></a>. This academic background equipped me with skills in <strong>rigorous data analysis, modeling, and research methods</strong>.</p>

<p>One project from that period that significantly shaped my perspective was <a href="https://design-instability.com/"><strong>Design Instability</strong></a>, a series of essays co-authored with <strong>Erik Stolterman</strong>. We explored the commonalities in <strong>architectural practices across disciplines</strong>, including classical design, UX design, and software engineering. This exploration helped me appreciate the <strong>value of cross-disciplinary thinking</strong>, a crucial skill for modern architects working at the intersection of technology, people, and business.</p>

<h3 id="developer-roots">Developer Roots</h3>

<p>Finally, I greatly value my early experience as a <strong>hands-on software developer</strong>. It’s important for architects to remain close to the code and to the developers who write it. This technical grounding has proven essential in all my subsequent roles.</p>

<p>Together, these experiences have shaped a practice that is <strong>data-informed, people-oriented, and grounded in real-world complexity</strong>. This book reflects those lessons—not as a theoretical model, but as a <strong>practitioner’s field guide</strong> for building architecture that truly works: <strong>inside real organizations, with real people, solving real problems</strong>.</p>

My work on creating and running an architecture practice isn’t just a lofty idea; it’s a <strong>practical approach</strong> sharpened from <strong>real-world experience.</strong> My perspective comes from lessons I learned as the Chief Architect at AVIV Group and the Principal Architect at eBay Classifieds and Adevinta.</p>

<p>To better grasp presented ideas or solutions, it is helpful to understand the problems we were trying to solve and <strong>the context</strong> in which these ideas were born. Here’s a peek into the context that shaped my Grounded Architecture approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global scale</strong>: the organizations I worked in were operating across multiple countries and continents with millions of users.</li>
  <li><strong>Multidimensional diversity</strong>: these organizations were diverse in terms of their customer base, workforce, business models, team topologies, and technology stacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Nonlinear growth dynamics</strong>: in addition to organic growth, complex organizations change their portfolio through mergers and acquisitions of new businesses or divestments.</li>
  <li><strong>Synergies and transformation pressures</strong>: complex organizations want to exploit the benefits of economies of scale and reduce duplication of efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized, loosely coupled organizational units</strong>: organizational units have significant autonomy while working together on common goals.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="global-scale">Global Scale</h2>

<p>I have honed my approach within genuinely global and multicultural organizations on a massive scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating across numerous <strong>geographies, cultures, and languages,</strong></li>
  <li>Serving <strong>millions of users</strong> daily,</li>
  <li>Collaborating with thousands of software <strong>developers</strong> across hundreds of product and development <strong>teams,</strong></li>
  <li>Implementing systems comprising hundreds of <strong>millions of lines of source code</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/earth-g217b5730b_1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Operating on a global scale introduces several compelling opportunities for organizations. It can significantly increase organizational effectiveness by <strong>reducing duplication of effort</strong> through centralized shared activities. Additionally, leveraging <strong>economies of scale</strong> allows for cost advantages, such as lowering the unit prices of utilized technologies. Global operations also enhance <strong>business resilience and flexibility</strong>, enabling compensation for local market fluctuations with global resources. The expansive talent pool available to global organizations supports local and international initiatives. Moreover, these organizations possess significant resources to invest in supporting nonlinear growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As).</p>

<p>However, the global and massive scale also presents numerous challenges. It results in <strong>high organizational complexity</strong>, with thousands of potential communication channels within the organization. The <strong>complex technology landscape</strong> entails numerous interconnected services. Managing a large talent pool incurs <strong>high workforce costs</strong>. Furthermore, such organizations face high computing resource expenses due to the need to serve a vast customer base around the clock. The operational complexity increases with high and variable customer demands across multiple locations. Additionally, global organizations have a <strong>vast attack surface</strong>, with many potential entry points for attackers. Lastly, any manual process, such as creating an organizational or technology landscape overview, is limited due to the scale involved.</p>

<p>Balancing opportunities and challenges on a global scale has been one of the most demanding and rewarding aspects of my architectural work. Such a magnitude makes any manual process inefficient and difficult to scale. The global scale was one of the main drivers behind the aggressive datafication of our an architecture practice. It has also led us to create more decentralized collaborative networks and operating models to execute and track decision-making across the board.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="multi-dimensional-diversity">Multi-Dimensional Diversity</h2>

<p>The organizations I worked with were incredibly diverse across multiple dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cultures</strong>: A varied workforce and clientele, both local and remote.</li>
  <li><strong>Organization</strong>: Units of different sizes, complexities, and organizational styles.</li>
  <li><strong>Product</strong>: Diverse product features catering to various markets and customer segments.</li>
  <li><strong>IT Architecture</strong>: Combination of legacy systems and modern approaches.</li>
  <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Numerous programming languages and thousands of third-party libraries, frameworks, and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, I worked with organizational units differing in several aspects, including <strong>unit size,</strong> which ranged from hundreds of employees to just a dozen. The <strong>team topologies</strong> varied, spanning from single-team setups to hierarchical team organizations. Additionally, the <strong>architectural roles</strong> varied, with some units having dedicated local architecture teams and lead architects. In contrast, in smaller units, team members handled architectural duties alongside other responsibilities.</p>

<p>Similarly, technology-wise, we managed a range of styles in active production systems, from legacy <strong>monolithic</strong> applications to intricate modern <strong>microservice</strong> and <strong>serverless</strong> ecosystems. Each organizational segment had its own unique history and legacy systems. Our technology stack was extensive, covering multiple mainstream technologies. The infrastructure included several public cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and custom-built private data centers. Our systems employ various application technologies, including database technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, AWS RDS, and more. The backend programming languages used were Java, C#, Go, Scala, PHP, Node.js. We used Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Flutter/Dart, and more for mobile app programming. The frontend programming languages and frameworks included React, AngularJS, Vue, jQuery, and others.</p>

<p>Diversity offers several <strong>opportunities,</strong> including increased technology <strong>innovation.</strong> A diverse workforce can explore a variety of technologies and tools creatively. It also leads to better implementation because access to a broader <strong>pool of diverse resources</strong> allows for the selection of the best tool for the job.</p>

<p>However, diversity also brings challenges. One such challenge is <strong>increased complexity,</strong> resulting in a higher system landscape complexity and greater cognitive load for teams mastering numerous topics simultaneously. Additionally, there is <strong>reduced flexibility,</strong> as expertise spread across many domains and technologies limits reorganization possibilities. Furthermore, diversity can lead to higher <strong>technical debt</strong> due to multiple technology stacks, increasing legacy components, and outdated technologies. While diversity is a rich source of new possibilities from an architectural perspective, it always necessitates carefully managing complexity.</p>

<p>Diversity has influenced our an architecture practice in multiple ways. It has led to the development of lean tools that can cover a broad range of technology stacks rather than the adoption of specialized ones that can go deep on one stack but cannot cover 95% of our landscape. We also adopted a more flexible governance model to help all teams in a practical way that is aligned with their diverse ways of working.</p>

<h2 id="nonlinear-growth-dynamics">Nonlinear Growth Dynamics</h2>

<p>Complex organizations like the ones I have worked in are often highly dynamic. These organizations frequently undergo significant growth, contraction, and reorganization, evolving both <strong>organically</strong> and <strong>inorganically.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Organic growth</strong> refers to internal expansion driven by the company’s own operations. <strong>Inorganic change</strong> involves acquiring other businesses, opening new locations, or divesting parts of the company.</p>

<p>Nonlinear growth, in particular, can be advantageous in several scenarios. It can <strong>rapidly increase the customer base</strong> or introduce new market segments. Additionally, such changes can <strong>accelerate innovation</strong> by incorporating new technologies or services.</p>

<p>However, nonlinear growth dynamics significantly impact architectural activities. The sudden integration of new companies <strong>increases organizational complexity</strong>, introducing many new units. Acquiring a new company also <strong>brings in new technology and engineering units</strong>, along with their unique processes and technology stacks. Furthermore, these nonlinear dynamics <strong>necessitate a flexible architecture</strong> to accommodate potential divestitures.</p>

<p>Nonlinear growth offers substantial benefits but also challenges managing increased complexity and the need to maintain architectural flexibility. In terms of its impact on an architecture practice, such dynamics lead to constantly high levels of complexity and more uncertainty. This has led us to prioritize the creation of better transparency to track changes that such dynamics introduce. We also needed to collaborate closely with business and finance stakeholders on developing tools for economics and risk modeling of investments and divestments.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="synergy-and-transformation-pressures">Synergy and Transformation Pressures</h2>

<p>Complex organizations aim to grow not just in size, but also in efficiency by leveraging economies of scale, cost synergies, and enhancing their capacity for innovation. Our investors expect us to become <strong>more than the sum of our original parts</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/gears-g06fe4e9a5_1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Pursuing synergies and transformations offers several opportunities, such as <strong>cost reductions</strong> through less duplication and lower expenses. <strong>Accelerated innovation</strong> can occur as savings from cost reductions free up resources for new developments. Additionally, creating synergistic components enables more possibilities for <strong>reuse and sharing,</strong> while well-executed transformations result in increased <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>lower unit costs.</strong></p>

<p>However, striving for synergies and efficiency presents challenges. There is a need for significant <strong>initial investment</strong> to realize benefits, which carries high risks. Performance pressure arises as teams must deliver excellent <strong>short-term results</strong> while undergoing significant transformations. Balancing transformation activities with regular work can temporarily <strong>reduce productivity.</strong> Moreover, post-transformation, the organization and technology landscape may become more complex due to increased dependencies, such as reusing central services.</p>

<p>The pressure to achieve synergies and efficiency can lead to high expectations and complicate regular architectural work. Nonetheless, these forces also create numerous opportunities for growth and improvement. For an architecture practice, these pressures created a strong need for better tracking project costs, value, and risks. Being able to calculate and back with data decisions for both innovative projects and legacy retirements was a critical aspect of our work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="decentralization-and-loose-coupling">Decentralization and Loose Coupling</h2>

<p>Researcher Karl Weick developed the concepts of tight and loose coupling to describe organizational structures, initially in educational institutions and later applied to diverse businesses. According to Weick, a <strong>tightly coupled organization</strong> has mutually understood rules enforced by <em>inspection and feedback</em> systems. In such organizations, management can directly coordinate different departments’ activities according to a central strategy.</p>

<p>In contrast, a <strong>loosely coupled organization</strong> lacks some elements of a tightly coupled one. Employees have <strong>more autonomy</strong>, and different departments may operate with <strong>little coordination</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1321965054.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

<p>Most organizational units I worked with were loosely coupled. Our companies frequently grew through acquisitions of companies in different marketplaces. Business strategies also promoted the independent evolution of local units to address local market needs more effectively and quickly. These units often enjoyed a high level of autonomy, frequently with their development teams and sometimes with local CFOs, CMOs, or CEOs.</p>

<p>Loose coupling offers several advantages. It provides <strong>higher flexibility,</strong> allowing units to develop independently and address specific needs without synchronizing with other units. This flexibility leads to <strong>reduced time-to-market,</strong> as fewer dependencies enable marketplaces to rapidly change and evolve their products for local needs. Additionally, loose coupling <strong>fosters innovation</strong> by offering opportunities to quickly explore ideas in smaller contexts.</p>

<p>However, loose coupling also presents several challenges. It can lead to duplication of effort, as local market needs might differ but often have significant overlap in product features and technology, resulting in <strong>redundant efforts</strong> as each marketplace creates solutions for the same problems. This approach also increases <strong>accidental diversity,</strong> where limited synchronization may result in significantly different design and technology choices for the same problem, making it difficult to consolidate solutions, move personnel between teams, or benefit from economies of scale. Moreover, loose coupling results in <strong>limited control,</strong> as fewer dependencies and varying goals make it more challenging to implement changes across the organization.</p>

<p>From an architectural perspective, loose coupling presents an interesting challenge, often leading to a conflict between global alignment and control and local autonomy. For our an architecture practice, decentralization and loose coupling led to many changes. We emphasized “hands off, eyes on,” leaving teams autonomy in their work but creating complete transparency based on data. Our operating model has a high level of decentralization to enable both scaling and alignment of architecture work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Grounded Architecture emerged as a necessity in response to our <a href="context">intricate and multifaceted challenges</a>. The Grounded Architecture framework was designed to address these specific challenges. By moving away from manual processes and embracing automation, data-driven decision-making, and adaptive frameworks, we aimed to create a <strong>more resilient and effective</strong> an architecture practice.</p>

<p>In following sections I will outline a breakdown of the goals I set for an architecture practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Goal 1: Executing At Scale,</li>
  <li>Goal 2: Adaptivity,</li>
  <li>Goal 3: Enhancing Decision-Making Quality with Data,</li>
  <li>Goal 4: Maximizing Organizational Alignment,</li>
  <li>Goal 5: Maximizing Organizational Learning.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-1-executing-at-scale">Goal 1: Executing At Scale</h2>

<p>Our organizations were like a bustling city with hundreds of teams and thousands of projects, each with its own unique complexity and requirements. Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches to an architecture practice simply couldn’t keep up with this dynamic environment. We needed a system that could support this vast and varied ecosystem. Grounded Architecture was designed to <strong>handle such diversity at scale,</strong> ensuring that teams and projects received the tailored support they needed without being bogged down by rigid processes.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always having the <strong>full transparency</strong> about the technology landscape. Without full transparency, it isn’t easy to understand the landscape’s complexity or your work’s context. This transparency should include good data and visualization of the size and quality of all source code repositories, public cloud accounts and technologies, private data centers, development efforts, etc.</li>
  <li>Having mechanisms and spaces to maintain <strong>practical working relationships</strong> with all development teams and key stakeholders. Knowing the organizational landscape and having spaces for engagement is crucial.</li>
  <li>Being able to scale and grow the organization <strong>without</strong> introducing significant <strong>slowing of decision-making</strong>. Finding the right balance between teams’ autonomy and alignment is essential.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-2-adaptivity">Goal 2: Adaptivity</h2>

<p>In our dynamic environments, significant change is not just frequent; it’s expected. Whether these changes are organic, like evolving business needs, or inorganic, like mergers and acquisitions, our architecture must be <strong>able to adapt swiftly</strong>. Grounded Architecture was crafted to be flexible and responsive, allowing us to pivot quickly in response to new challenges and opportunities. This adaptability ensures that our architectural framework remains relevant and effective, no matter how the organizational landscape shifts.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Being able to track and support <strong>legacy and new technologies,</strong> adapting this support as the organization transforms, grows, acquires new legacy, and adopts new technologies.</li>
  <li>Having <strong>readily available data</strong> for analyses of different business scenarios (e.g., retire legacy vs. investment in legacy, buy-or-build, divestments).</li>
  <li>Being able to <strong>routinely onboard</strong> and quickly understand the technology landscape of acquired companies.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-3-enhancing-decision-making-quality-with-data">Goal 3: Enhancing Decision-Making Quality with Data</h2>

<p>Relying on gut feelings or individual opinions is always insufficient and risky when dealing with operations at scale. Decisions need to be based on solid data to <strong>ensure accuracy and reliability.</strong> Grounded Architecture aims to incorporate tools and mechanisms to support data-driven decision-making. By leveraging data and analytics, we can move away from subjective opinions and towards more objective, evidence-based decisions. This approach should enhance the quality of our decisions and facilitate their consistency and alignment with our organizational goals.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always having <strong>complete</strong>, <strong>up-to-date data</strong> about all key elements of the organizational technology landscape.</li>
  <li>Having technical data connected with <strong>product</strong> and <strong>business data</strong> (e.g., vibrancy vs. public cloud costs).</li>
  <li>Making data available via <strong>self-service tools</strong> for the organization so that more people can make data-informed decisions.</li>
  <li>Ensuring <strong>routine usage</strong> of the data in decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-4-maximizing-organizational-alignment">Goal 4: Maximizing Organizational Alignment</h2>

<p>In a global, fast-moving organization, misalignment can quickly become the norm. Different teams and departments might pursue conflicting objectives, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. Grounded Architecture aims to <strong>serve as a cohesive force,</strong> promoting alignment across the entire organization. Providing a clear, unified framework helps to minimize misalignments. It facilitates all parts of the organization working towards common goals. This alignment is crucial for maintaining efficiency and avoiding the chaos that can arise from disparate efforts.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Having pragmatic <strong>standardized guidelines</strong> and best practices (e.g., golden paths) for technology use, ensuring consistency across the organization.</li>
  <li>Fostering a <strong>culture of collaboration</strong> and knowledge sharing among teams to align on technology choices and implementation strategies.</li>
  <li>Regularly <strong>reviewing and updating</strong> technology standards to align with evolving business needs and industry trends.</li>
  <li>Identifying and eliminating <strong>redundant processes</strong> and activities to streamline operations and reduce wasted resources.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-5-maximizing-organizational-learning">Goal 5: Maximizing Organizational Learning</h2>

<p>Staying current with emerging technologies and industry trends is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. Still, it can be challenging when dealing with the demands of legacy systems. Grounded Architecture should facilitate continuous learning and growth. It supports the rapid adoption of new technologies and encourages <strong>ongoing education and training.</strong> Grounded Architecture should ensure we always have the best tools and knowledge to drive innovation and improvement.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organizing frequent workshops, seminars, and training sessions to facilitate <strong>sharing knowledge</strong> and best practices across the organization.</li>
  <li>Encouraging employees at all levels to contribute to and participate in knowledge-sharing initiatives, promoting a <strong>culture of continuous learning.</strong></li>
  <li>Developing platforms and tools that enable <strong>easy access</strong> to shared knowledge and resources, enhancing collective expertise.</li>
  <li>Involving <strong>diverse stakeholders,</strong> including developers, managers, and end-users, in discussions and decision-making processes related to architecture and technology.</li>
  <li><strong>Creating opportunities</strong> for employees from various departments to engage in architectural planning and feedback sessions to learn from each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>These criteria aim to create an inclusive and dynamic environment where knowledge is freely shared, and diverse contributions are not just welcomed, but valued.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<p>Knowing what goals an architecture practice needs to support in your organization is crucial to defining structures and measuring your impact. Some of the plans may be universally applicable. Others may be unique to your context. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What is the scale of your an architecture practice? Does your scale require special measures to ensure your an architecture practice efficient operations?</em></li>
  <li><em>What are the key decisions you need to make? Do you have the data to base your decisions?</em></li>
  <li><em>How aligned are units in your organizations? How much friction is there? How can an architecture practice help?</em></li>
  <li><em>How much is your organization learning? How is the learning supported?</em></li>
  <li><em>How stable is your organization? How likely is it that significant changes will occur in your organization?</em></li>

<p><br />
In this part, I will briefly introduce the Grounded Architecture framework. I chose the term “Grounded Architecture” to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is <strong>avoid having an “ivory tower” an architecture practice</strong> disconnected from the organization. This disconnection is a real danger in a <a href="context">fast-moving, global, and diverse setting</a>.</p>

<p>The Grounded Architecture framework is designed to be a <strong>practical solution.</strong> It aims to be <strong>deeply rooted</strong> in the organization, prioritizing <strong>people’s interactions</strong> and <strong>data</strong> over processes and tools. The goal is to connect an architecture practice to all parts and levels of the organization, serving as a practical antidote to the ‘ivory tower’ architecture. In this part of the ebook, I will delve into the framework’s structure and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Grounded Architecture framework is an approach to setting organizational structures for an architecture practice, and it has three elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight Architectural Analytics (Data),</li>
  <li>Collaborative Networks (People),</li>
  <li>The Operating Model.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework.</em></p>

<p><em>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</em> is <strong>a system of tools and resources</strong> that enables architects to make <strong>data-informed decisions</strong> based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization’s technology landscape. <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics section</a> provides more details.</p>

<p><em>Collaborative Networks</em> <strong>connect all the people</strong> doing architecture across the organization. Thse networks are crucial to ensure that an architecture practice has any <strong>tangible impact</strong>. The <a href="people">Collaborative Networks section</a> provides more details.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <em>Operating Model</em> introduces:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="operating-model">General Principles</a></strong>: I’ve defined several <strong>general guidelines</strong> on directing architects to do everything an architecture practice typically does, leveraging Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="six-simple-rules">Cooperation-Based Operating Model: Six Simple Rules</a></strong>: Grounded Architecture is particularly well-suited for organizations organized based on cooperation. As businesses grow increasingly complex, the importance of cooperation within organizational structures cannot be overstated. The “Six Simple Rules” framework emphasizes that successful organizations leverage their members’ collective judgment and cooperation. By fostering a culture of collaboration, organizations can better utilize their capabilities to address and resolve complex problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="governance">IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates</a></strong>: Governance in technology is a critical aspect of any operating model. I propose a governance model incorporating three styles: nudging, taxation, and mandates. Nudging involves subtle policy shifts that guide behavior without restricting choices, while taxation uses economic incentives to encourage desired outcomes. Mandates and bans provide direct regulations to ensure compliance and standardization. This multifaceted approach allows for flexible and effective governance, balancing innovation with control and ensuring technological initiatives align with broader organizational goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="gen-ai-potential">Leveraging The Full Potential of Generative AI for IT Architecture</a></strong>: You can responsibly leverage Generative AI as a powerful augmentation tool to enhance efficiency, data-driven insights, and collaboration, provided you proactively manage its inherent risks and maintain critical human oversight</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While I elaborately discuss many faces of the operating model, I want to emphasize that any Operating Model is only relevant if there are <strong>healthy Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks</strong>. Without data and people connections, an operating model leads to an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.</p>

<p>In every organization where I have built an architecture practice, I have <strong>strongly—some might say obsessively—emphasized the importance of data</strong>. One of the first steps I take is to establish a <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> capability (Figure 1). This step is crucial for obtaining a <strong>comprehensive and up-to-date view of the organization’s technology landscape</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-start-with-data">Why I Start With Data:</h2>

<p>Manual documentation simply does not scale. It becomes outdated quickly and requires excessive effort to maintain. In contrast, <strong>data is scalable, repeatable, and reliable</strong>. When executed correctly, data serves as the <strong>foundation for effective and consistent architectural decision-making</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-good-news-you-already-have-the-data">The Good News: You Already Have the Data</h3>

<p>The good news? <strong>Most large organizations already possess ample data.</strong> It is just scattered across various tools, teams, and formats.</p>

<p>With the right combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Automation</strong> (to collect and maintain data)</li>
  <li><strong>Curation</strong> (to clean and contextualize the data),</li>
</ul>

<p>…you can unlock valuable architectural insights far more easily than you might expect.</p>

<h3 id="why-lightweight">Why “Lightweight”?</h3>

<p>I use the term <strong>lightweight</strong> intentionally. This approach does not involve purchasing expensive software or establishing a massive data warehouse from day one. Instead, it is about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Starting small and simple</strong></li>
  <li>Using <strong>open-source or low-cost tools</strong></li>
  <li>Focusing on <strong>what’s actionable rather than just what’s impressive</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can derive real value using a handful of smart scripts, well-designed dashboards, and a willingness to experiment. The goal is to <strong>obtain just enough structure and visibility</strong> to facilitate better decisions—without creating a new bureaucracy.</p>

<p>This section will explore how Lightweight Architectural Analytics works in practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What data is useful</li>
  <li>How to collect it</li>
  <li>How to visualize and share it</li>
  <li>And how to use it to drive alignment, reduce waste, and support effective architecture at scale</li>
</ul>

<p>If architecture involves guiding complex systems through change, then data is the <strong>compass</strong> that helps keep us oriented in the right direction.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="examples-of-lightweight-architectural-analytics-tools">Examples of Lightweight Architectural Analytics Tools</h2>

<p>To clarify what I mean by <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong>, I will share some concrete examples from my recent work. These tools are part of a modular dashboard we have developed and extensively used at <strong>AVIV Group</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/apps.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" /><br />
<strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Start page of the architecture analytics dashboard used at AVIV Group.</em></p>

<p>I typically implement <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> as a <strong>collection of focused data applications</strong> aggregated into a simple dashboard. These tools are built on top of <strong>existing organizational data</strong> and provide accessible insights with minimal setup and maintenance.</p>

<p>Each application draws from one or more of the following <strong>data streams</strong>, which are often readily available in large organizations:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/figures/architecture-dashboard-data-sources.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" /><br />
<strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Overview of core data sources powering the architecture dashboard.</em></p>

<p><strong>Source Code Repositories</strong>: Your source code is a valuable source of architectural signals. By analyzing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commit histories</li>
  <li>Complexity trends</li>
  <li>Contributor patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>…you can uncover valuable insights into <strong>technical debt</strong>, <strong>team interactions</strong>, and <strong>system hotspots</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Public Cloud Billing Reports</strong>: Cloud billing data reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which services are being utilized</li>
  <li>Areas of potential inefficiency</li>
  <li>Cost trends across <strong>regions, teams, and services</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This information supports more accountable cloud usage and budget-conscious design decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Reports</strong>: Incident data highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recurring issues</li>
  <li>Weak points in system design</li>
  <li>Dependencies between systems and teams</li>
</ul>

<p>Analyzing these trends can improve <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, and <strong>incident response planning</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Business &amp; Product Metrics (e.g., User Activity)</strong>: By tracking core usage metrics, such as <strong>user activity</strong> or <strong>system vibrancy</strong>, architects gain visibility into how systems support real-world business outcomes, providing an essential link between technology and products.</p>

<p><strong>Messaging &amp; Collaboration Tools</strong>: Platforms like <strong>Slack</strong> offer insights into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team collaboration patterns</li>
  <li>Frequent technical discussions</li>
  <li>Emerging pain points or themes</li>
</ul>

<p>These insights help architects stay connected to the operational realities without the need for constant meetings.</p>

<p>In the following sections, I will guide you through a selection of these <strong>data-driven architecture tools</strong>, explaining how they were built, the insights they offer, and how they have facilitated architectural decision-making at scale.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-1-source-code-and-commit-history-analytics">Example 1: Source Code and Commit History Analytics</h3>

<p>Your <strong>source code</strong> and <strong>commit history</strong> are a valuable source of insights—an often-overlooked asset in architectural work. Within that history lie powerful signals about your <strong>technology stack</strong>, <strong>team dynamics</strong>, <strong>dependencies</strong>, and the <strong>quality and structure of your systems</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="meet-sokrates-an-architects-x-ray-vision">Meet Sokrates: An Architect’s X-Ray Vision</h4>

<p>To help you harness this potential without becoming overwhelmed, I developed and actively maintain an open-source tool called <strong><a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sokrates</strong> is a free, lightweight tool that analyzes codebases across multiple repositories and generates intuitive, visual reports that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Easy to explore</strong>, even for non-developers.</li>
  <li><strong>High-level and strategic</strong>, ideal for CTOs and architecture reviews.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed and tactical</strong>, useful for in-depth analyses and code critiques.</li>
</ul>

<p>It allows you to <strong>zoom out</strong> for a broad overview of your organization’s code and <strong>zoom in</strong> to inspect specific teams, technologies, or problem areas. Think of it as <strong>an architect’s x-ray vision</strong> into your source code ecosystem.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/sokrates-example-1.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" /><br />
<strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Screenshot from a Sokrates report dashboard.</em></p>

<h4 id="show-me-dont-just-tell-me">Show Me, Don’t Just Tell Me</h4>

<p>Curious what this looks like on a larger scale? Here are a few real examples of <strong>Sokrates in action</strong>, analyzing large open-source landscapes:</p>

<p>These reports illustrate how Sokrates can uncover patterns across thousands of projects—providing valuable insights into code health, ownership, and evolution.</p>

<h4 id="specialized-analyses-for-architecture-insights">Specialized Analyses for Architecture Insights</h4>

<p>In addition to standard commit and repository analysis, I’ve developed several <strong>specialized tools</strong> that extract architecture-relevant signals from code and tooling:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CI/CD Insights</strong> (via Travis &amp; Jenkins Analyzers): Understand how teams build, test, and deploy.</li>
  <li><strong>Dockerfile Scanner</strong>: Create a real-time <strong>tech radar</strong> of the runtime technologies used across teams.</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub PR Activity Monitor</strong>: Measure deployment frequency and identify bottlenecks or silos.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="build-your-own">Build Your Own</h4>

<p>Sokrates is open-source and ready to use, but even if you choose to create your own tools or pipelines, I encourage you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experiment with <strong>what matters most</strong> to your organization.</li>
  <li>Connect <strong>code signals to business context</strong>.</li>
  <li>Share insights <strong>visually</strong> to maximize their impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Start small, automate early, and let the data guide you to architect smarter solutions.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-2-public-cloud-usage-analytics">Example 2: Public Cloud Usage Analytics</h3>

<p>One of the key advantages of using public cloud platforms is the <strong>built-in visibility and standardization</strong> they provide. With <strong>uniform automation and monitoring</strong>, public cloud environments offer a level of <strong>transparency</strong> that is challenging to replicate in traditional infrastructures.</p>

<p>Providers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com"><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/"><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong></a>, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/"><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong></a> make <strong>detailed usage data readily available</strong>. This includes insights into:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Which services are used</strong> and by whom</li>
  <li><strong>What resource types</strong> and regions are consuming the most</li>
  <li><strong>Team or project-level billing and budget trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Access permissions and ownership breakdowns</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This data is invaluable for architects looking to <strong>understand usage patterns, manage costs</strong>, and <strong>enhance architectural efficiency</strong> across the organization.</p>

<p>To capitalize on this, I developed several open-source custom tools called <strong>Cloud Usage Explorer</strong>, which visualizes data from standard <strong>cloud usage reports</strong>. It transforms raw billing data into <strong>clear, actionable dashboards</strong> that track consumption, trends, and anomalies in near real-time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/archdata/cloud-usage-explorer.png" alt="" />
<br />
<em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> An example of a cloud usage explorer.</em></p>

<p>By leveraging this type of cloud usage data through Lightweight Architectural Analytics, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify <strong>underutilized or misconfigured resources</strong></li>
  <li>Encourage <strong>cost-aware decision-making</strong> among teams</li>
  <li>Promote <strong>more efficient architectural design patterns</strong></li>
  <li>Track the evolution of platform usage over time</li>
  <li>Detect <strong>siloed or duplicated efforts</strong> across teams</li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly, you can accomplish all of this using <strong>data you already have</strong>, through <strong>simple automation and smart visualization</strong>—there’s no need for enterprise-scale tooling right from the start.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-3-business--finance-data--a-hidden-gem">Example 3: Business &amp; Finance Data — A Hidden Gem</h3>

<p><strong>Finance departments</strong> are often the unsung heroes of enterprise data. Consider them the <strong>Sherlock Holmes of the business</strong>—relentlessly data-driven, meticulous, and always equipped with high-quality, structured information. While they are primarily known for tracking <strong>costs, budgets, and forecasts</strong>, they often monitor much more than just these “dry” figures.</p>

<p>In my experience, finance teams frequently track <strong>vibrancy</strong>, <strong>usage levels</strong>, and <strong>system engagement metrics</strong>. They do this not out of mere curiosity, but to <strong>connect financial performance with system usage</strong>. This type of data is a <strong>goldmine for architects</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h4>

<p>By linking <strong>financial data</strong> (such as cloud costs) with <strong>usage and vibrancy metrics</strong>, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uncover <strong>underutilized systems</strong> that are still incurring high costs.</li>
  <li>Identify platforms that have a <strong>high business impact</strong> and warrant further investment.</li>
  <li>Highlight <strong>inefficiencies</strong> in scaling, infrastructure, or usage patterns.</li>
  <li>Strengthen business cases for <strong>optimization or redesign</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/cross-data.png" alt="" />
<br />
<em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Combining data from different sources (e.g., cloud billing reports and vibrancy or revenue can lead to new insights (e.g., identifying inefficiencies in the application portfolio).</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="a-real-world-tip">A Real-World Tip</h4>

<p>When you’re deep into architectural planning—whether mapping platforms, defining investment strategies, or discussing redesigns—<strong>don’t forget to consult the finance team</strong>. They likely possess insights that can enhance your strategy and <strong>anchor your architecture in real business value</strong>.</p>

<p>While finance may not be present in architecture meetings, they hold some of the <strong>most actionable data in the organization</strong>. Integrating this data into your architecture discussions will enable you to make decisions that are not only technically sound but also economically and strategically aligned.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-4-leveraging-generative-ai">Example 4: Leveraging Generative AI</h3>

<p>Once you’ve established a solid foundation of <strong>curated, up-to-date, and accessible data</strong>, you unlock a powerful new layer of value through <strong>Generative AI tools</strong>—such as <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong>, or various <strong>open-source LLMs</strong>. These models serve as <strong>intelligent companions</strong> for architectural work, transforming your data into <strong>interactive, dynamic conversations</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of relying solely on static dashboards or one-time reports, you can now ask natural language questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Which teams are contributing the most to legacy systems?”</li>
  <li>“Which services have the worst cost-to-vibrancy ratio?”</li>
  <li>“Can you cluster microservices by team ownership and code churn?”</li>
  <li>“What anomalies occurred in our incident patterns over the past quarter?”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-it-works">Why It Works</h4>

<p>This approach is effective only when your <strong>underlying data is well-structured and readily available</strong>, which is precisely what <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> is designed to provide. Without that foundation, Generative AI lacks meaningful data to work with.</p>

<h4 id="practical-use-cases">Practical Use Cases</h4>

<p>Here are several ways I’ve utilized Generative AI tools in conjunction with architectural data:</p>

<p><strong>Source Code Insights</strong>: Upload Sokrates reports or raw commit logs and prompt the AI with questions about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code complexity hotspots</li>
  <li>Ownership overlaps or silos</li>
  <li>Changes in deployment frequency over time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cloud Usage &amp; Cost Optimization</strong>: Feed in cloud billing reports and ask the AI to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect underutilized services</li>
  <li>Highlight high-cost/low-impact areas</li>
  <li>Summarize team-specific cloud trends</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Incident Pattern Detection</strong>: Analyze incident ticket data to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify frequent root causes</li>
  <li>Recognize recurring impacted services</li>
  <li>Discover trends in team-specific incident ownership</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Business Metrics Correlation</strong>: Correlate system <strong>vibrancy</strong>, <strong>uptime</strong>, or <strong>adoption</strong> with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team sizes</li>
  <li>Architectural changes</li>
  <li>Operational costs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communication &amp; Collaboration Trends</strong>: Use logs from tools like Slack to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uncover dominant discussion themes</li>
  <li>Track inter-team collaboration patterns</li>
  <li>Identify shifts in focus over time</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, Generative AI serves as a <strong>first-pass analyst</strong>, revealing patterns, anomalies, or new ways of framing problems. This enables architects to <strong>move faster, dig deeper, and think broader</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="prompts-as-reusable-thinking-tools">Prompts as Reusable Thinking Tools</h4>

<p>Prompts aren’t merely one-time commands; they are a <strong>reusable, transparent expression of architectural intent</strong>. Over time, prompts can become:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A form of <strong>lightweight documentation</strong> for common questions and analyses</li>
  <li>A <strong>repeatable template</strong> for querying new datasets</li>
  <li>A method to <strong>share architectural reasoning</strong> across teams</li>
  <li>A <strong>teaching tool</strong> to assist junior team members facing real-world architectural challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider prompts as <strong>scripts for architectural sensemaking</strong>—fast, flexible, and easy to refine as your practice evolves.</p>

<p>For examples, please refer to the <a href="gen-ai-prompts"><strong>Appendix on Generative AI Prompts</strong></a>, where I’ve included ready-to-use prompt templates and sample datasets to help you get started.</p>

<p>Generative AI doesn’t replace architectural judgment; it <strong>amplifies</strong> it. When paired with good data and clear thinking, it becomes a powerful ally in addressing complexity, accelerating insight, and enhancing your practice.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-lightweight-architectural-analytics">Requirements for Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h2>

<p><strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> should serve as a central, trusted resource—your organization’s <strong>source of truth</strong> for architectural insights. It’s not merely a storage bin for random metrics; it’s a curated space of <strong>authoritative, relevant, and accessible data</strong> that enables informed decisions and confident actions.</p>

<p>Technically, you can start small. I’ve seen organizations build early versions using <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Confluence</strong>, or even <strong>documents pinned to a wall</strong>. However, I strongly recommend investing in a <strong>better user experience and infrastructure</strong>. When executed well, Lightweight Architectural Analytics becomes a <strong>valuable organizational asset</strong>—not a digital junk drawer.</p>

<p>Collecting data isn’t enough. To make your analytics useful, it must meet <strong>several key requirements</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="single-point-of-truth">Single Point of Truth</h3>

<p>People need to know exactly where to go. Your analytics hub should serve as the <strong>central reference</strong> for all relevant architectural data—no guessing, no scattered files, and no contradictory versions. Ask yourself: <em>If someone starts tomorrow, would they be able to find what they need in one place?</em></p>

<h3 id="curated-for-quality">Curated for Quality</h3>

<p>Data without trust is simply noise. You must take ownership of <strong>curation</strong>, ensuring that the data is accurate, meaningful, and transparent. Whenever possible, link back to <strong>original data sources</strong> so others can verify the facts. Think of yourself more as an editor than just a collector.</p>

<h3 id="curated-for-usability">Curated for Usability</h3>

<p>People need focus, not friction. Filter out irrelevant information. Highlight what matters. Design your tools and dashboards with <strong>clarity in mind</strong>—investing in <strong>user experience (UX)</strong> isn’t a luxury; it’s essential for making the data usable. It’s not about having all the data; it’s about having the <strong>right data, clearly presented</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="kept-up-to-date">Kept Up to Date</h3>

<p>Stale data is dangerous. Your system should refresh data <strong>automatically</strong> or through <strong>repeatable, lightweight processes</strong>. When people see that the data is fresh, they’ll be more likely to trust and use it.</p>

<h3 id="accessible-to-the-whole-organization">Accessible to the Whole Organization</h3>

<p>Architectural data shouldn’t be restricted to a select few. When you give teams access to insights that were once reserved for “architects” or “leadership,” you empower them to act more quickly, make better decisions, and reduce dependency. Transparency accelerates performance.</p>

<h3 id="used-in-decision-making">Used in Decision-Making</h3>

<p>Curated data that sits unused is a wasted effort. Your analytics must be incorporated into <strong>actual decision-making processes</strong>—in design reviews, strategy sessions, prioritization meetings, and product planning. Good architecture is informed by data.</p>

<h3 id="built-like-a-map">Built Like a Map</h3>

<p>The best metaphor for this type of analytics is a <strong>map</strong>. A good map provides <strong>orientation</strong> in a complex landscape. It shows where the treasure is and warns you of where dangers lie. Your architectural data should do the same—helping people understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What exists</li>
  <li>How things are connected</li>
  <li>Where things are healthy or broken</li>
  <li>Who is responsible</li>
  <li>What is at risk</li>
  <li>What should be done next</li>
</ul>

<p>Like real maps, it should have <strong>layers</strong>—views that reveal <strong>different dimensions</strong> of your systems: performance, quality, dependencies, cost, ownership, activity, and more.</p>

<p>By meeting these requirements, <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> becomes more than just a tool; it becomes a <strong>strategic capability</strong>—something that makes your entire organization smarter, faster, and more aligned.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="tips-for-building-lightweight-architectural-analytics">Tips for Building Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h2>

<p>Every organization has its own quirks when it comes to data, but after establishing architectural practices across several companies, I’ve noticed some common patterns and practical strategies. If you’re starting (or rebooting) a <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> initiative, here are some key tips to make your journey smoother—and perhaps even enjoyable:</p>

<h3 id="start-with-the-source-code">Start With the Source Code</h3>

<p>My motto is: <strong><em>“Talk is expensive. Show me the code.”</em></strong></p>

<p>Why? Because <strong>code never lies.</strong> It’s the most honest and up-to-date documentation of what’s really happening in your systems. While people may forget details or creatively reinterpret them, your repositories will tell the truth—messy or not.</p>

<p>Modern IT systems store nearly everything in code: infrastructure, pipelines, configurations, and documentation. This makes source code the <strong>richest and most reliable source of architectural insight</strong>.</p>

<p>I use tools like <a href="https://sokrates.dev"><strong>Sokrates</strong></a> to scan repositories early on. You’d be surprised how often these scans reveal that a “simple legacy service” is, in fact, a <strong>spaghetti monster in disguise</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="connect-with-finance-and-governance">Connect With Finance and Governance</h3>

<p>Another motto: <strong><em>“Follow the money!”</em></strong></p>

<p>Finance and governance teams often collect <strong>high-quality, structured, and underutilized data</strong>—from cloud billing reports to technology cost breakdowns. This data is already being tracked for compliance and budget forecasting, so why not utilize it for architecture?</p>

<p>You don’t need revenue projections or sensitive figures. Just access to usage and cost data can unlock <strong>unexpected insights</strong> about system efficiency, platform sprawl, and ROI blind spots.</p>

<h3 id="maintain-a-culture-of-transparency">Maintain a Culture of Transparency</h3>

<p>Transparency isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a <strong>strategic enabler</strong>.</p>

<p>A transparent organization shares information freely, trusts its people with data, and reduces red tape. When you eliminate the need for complex access control mechanisms or bureaucratic workflows, your architecture practice can move faster and remain better aligned with reality.</p>

<p>Transparency also <strong>fosters trust</strong>—people are more likely to use and contribute to your analytics when they see it is open and well-intentioned.</p>

<h3 id="own-the-curation">Own the Curation</h3>

<p>Raw data doesn’t generate value. <strong>Curation does.</strong></p>

<p>You need to thoroughly understand your data sources, filter out the noise, and present the <strong>most relevant and trustworthy insights</strong> in a clear and consistent manner. This isn’t just a backend task; it’s a <strong>UX design problem</strong>.</p>

<p>As the curator of your Lightweight Architectural Analytics, think of yourself as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An editor, not just an aggregator</li>
  <li>A guide, not just a dashboard builder</li>
  <li>A storyteller, helping teams navigate their complex systems with clarity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-simple-maintainable-infrastructure">Use Simple, Maintainable Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Keep it light. Keep it lean.</p>

<p>I publish most of our analytics (like Sokrates reports) as <strong>static resources hosted on GitHub Pages</strong>. This approach eliminates the need for a backend, databases, and maintenance overhead.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/zeljkoobrenovic/grounded-architecture-dashboard-examples"><strong>Architecture Dashboard Examples repository</strong></a>, which includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The dashboard source code (HTML + JSON)</li>
  <li>Lightweight visualizations</li>
  <li>A live demo hosted <a href="https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/grounded-architecture-dashboard-examples/">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This design is simple—easy to deploy, easy to share, and easy to trust.</p>

<h3 id="final-thought-dont-drown-in-data">Final Thought: Don’t Drown in Data</h3>

<p>With these tips, you can avoid the pitfalls of data chaos. Lightweight Architectural Analytics doesn’t have to be expensive or overly complex. It just needs to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Honest</li>
  <li>Relevant</li>
  <li>Usable</li>
  <li>And <em>maintained with care</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If nothing else, these practices may save you from your next “How did this get so bad?” meeting—or at least provide you with a few laughs along the way.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="tips-for-using-lightweight-architectural-analytics">Tips for Using Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h2>

<p>Lightweight Architectural Analytics can generate vast amounts of data. It’s akin to having an <strong>atlas of your entire digital landscape</strong>—great for orienting yourself and identifying opportunities. However, maps alone don’t provide direction; it’s the mindset you adopt while interpreting them that truly matters.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-2166193783.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p><br />
Using analytics is like solving a mystery. The data contains answers—but <strong>only if you ask the right questions</strong>. With the right mindset, you can transform <em>information overload</em> into <em>architecture superpowers</em>.</p>

<p>Here are some detective-style questions to help make sense of architectural data:</p>

<h3 id="are-we-all-rowing-in-the-same-direction">Are We All Rowing in the Same Direction?</h3>

<p>Utilize code overviews, cloud usage explorers, or tech radars to identify <strong>misalignments among teams and systems</strong>. Diverging technology stacks, inconsistent platform usage, or duplicated functionality can lead to <strong>productive debates</strong> and drive real improvements.</p>

<h3 id="are-we-making-the-most-of-our-technology">Are We Making the Most of Our Technology?</h3>

<p>By comparing usage trends across teams, you may uncover <strong>hidden virtuosos</strong>—those who innovate with limited resources—and <strong>bottlenecks</strong>, where adoption is low despite high investment. Both reveal valuable insights.</p>

<h3 id="do-our-systems-need-a-little-tlc">Do Our Systems Need a Little TLC?</h3>

<p>Analytics can highlight:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized systems</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Rampant duplication</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“God files”</strong> that dominate commit histories</li>
</ul>

<p>These are indicators that part of your architecture may be <strong>due for a health check—or a rewrite</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, if the number of Git merges increases proportionally with team size, while delivery speed does not improve—something is amiss. Scaling can lead to better output, but sometimes it just creates <strong>a larger digital mosh pit</strong>.</p>

<p><br />
Good architects are a rare breed. They bridge the gaps between business, product, organizational, and technology issues. They’re like the Swiss Army knives of the tech world. Hiring architects is like searching for a unicorn who’s also a full-stack developer with a knack for diplomacy. They need not only in-depth technical knowledge but also domain-specific and organizational knowledge.</p>

<p>So, you cannot just 3D print your architects or hire them in buckets. But you can carefully organize, empower, and leverage this scarce talent (Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-people.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework: Collaborative Networks.</em></p>

<p>A strong network of people doing architecture is crucial for any real impact. In simpler terms, <strong>Strong Architecture = Strong Architects</strong>.</p>

<p>In my recent escapades, I worked with two teams of architect teams: a small <strong>central architecture team</strong> and <strong>a cross-organizational distributed virtual team</strong>. The central team is like the wise elders, guiding and supporting the rest of the organization. The distributed virtual team, on the other hand, is a merry band of rebels, working locally but also connecting across the organization, increasing transparency, building networks, and implementing change. Together, such a mix of central and distributed teams can create a robust <strong>collaborative network</strong> driving change across an organization.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="background-central-vs-federated-architecture-practice">Background: Central vs. Federated Architecture Practice</h2>

<p>An IT architecture practice generally follow one of two fundamental models: central or federated (Figure 2, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/crafting-the-optimal-model-for-the-it-architecture-organization">McKinsey 2022</a>).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/arch_teams.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Central vs. Federated Architecture Practice.</em></p>

<p><strong>The central model</strong> is like a tightly run coffee shop. A large central team sets the rules, approves new work, and ensures everyone follows the script. Development teams in this model are like customers with no coffee-making skills, relying entirely on the central baristas. The central team handles infrastructure, operations, and security—essentially controlling the caffeine supply chain.</p>

<p><strong>The federated model</strong> is more like a coffee co-op, where each team has its own barista. A small central team or an <strong>architecture center of excellence (CoE)</strong> might provide high-level guidance, but the real magic happens locally. These baristas (architects) are embedded in development teams, facilitating high-level planning and acting as on-demand service providers.</p>

<p>The <strong>federated model</strong> is a favorite among <strong>cross-functional DevOps cultures</strong>. It integrates infrastructure, operations, and security into its brews. Architects in this model focus on <strong>facilitation and enablement</strong>, and stay close to the action.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="the-hybrid-model">The Hybrid Model</h2>

<p>To operate in a complex context, you must invest effort to ensure you have the <strong>right people at the right places</strong>. In the end, I usually found it best to adopt a model of a hybrid organization combining elements of central and federated orientation structures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Small Central Architectural Team, and</li>
  <li>Architecture Guilds &amp; Virtual Architectural Teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>This model is similar to the previously described <strong>federated model</strong> but with extra investment in a central team that should be more than just an on-demand service provider.</p>

<p>Think of it as a symphony orchestra, where the central team is the conductor, and the guilds and virtual teams are the talented musicians playing different instruments. Sure, each musician can play their part solo, but without the conductor, it might sound more like a chaotic jam session at your neighbor’s garage.</p>

<p>I prefer the <strong>hybrid team structure</strong> as it scales better in complex organizations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Guilds</strong> and virtual architecture teams support execution by <strong>increasing the number of people involved</strong> in architectural activities and increasing work efficiency through better alignment. Members representing various organizational units can have much <strong>more impact across the board</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having some <strong>capacity on the central level</strong> serves as a <strong>catalyst,</strong> helping people at local levels to do their jobs while being aligned and better connected with overall strategic goals and other teams working on related topics.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="central-architecture-team">Central Architecture Team</h3>

<p>The roles of people in central teams may differ depending on the organization. However, it’s crucial to recognize uniwue value a central architecture team.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-480342200.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Such a team, in addition to the doing architecture work, can be instrumental in covering these often overlooked responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build and maintain the architecture <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a>.</strong> With all AI advances, it will not build itself! You need clear ownership, curation, and technical support to make it work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Promote data-informed decision-making.</strong> It’s not enough to have data; you’ve got to <em>use</em> it. This is like trying to convince your grandpa to use a smartphone—challenging but doable. Architects should be tech-savvy wizards who show everyone else how things are done, making data the critical actor of every decision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proactively identify, connect, and maintain relationships with all relevant stakeholders.</strong> Think of architects as the social butterflies at a high school reunion—they’ve got to bridge all the cliques. Connecting different organizational units and stakeholders is their superpower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build internal architecture communities and guilds.</strong> Organizing rituals and gatherings takes effort.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While guilds and virtual teams can handle many of these activities, their voluntary and sometimes laid-back nature makes their support less reliable. The central architecture team can step in like the dependable backup generator, taking full long-term ownership and ensuring continuity, even if the community vibe fizzles out.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="architecture-guilds--virtual-architecture-teams">Architecture Guilds &amp; Virtual Architecture Teams</h3>

<p>I’ve always found it crucial to rally passionate troops about architecture through a guild, a community of interest, or a virtual team. After all, who doesn’t love a good architecture geek meet-up?</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1199706305.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Our guilds or virtual team members typically double as architects or tech leads in their respective departments. But they also moonlight by collaborating with their counterparts from other areas. These <strong>peer-to-peer communities</strong> are collectively responsible for spotting and nurturing architectural talent, mentoring, and helping each other out of sticky situations.</p>

<p>If you end up having an overabundance of guilds and teams, you can try splitting them into different cliques:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>General or core teams</strong>: These folks could tackle various general architectural topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialist teams</strong>: These teams can focus on specific parts of the tech stack, such as native mobile apps, web frontends, or public clouds.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic initiatives teams</strong>: These teams work on the big picture, such as data strategy, public cloud strategy, transactions, or verticalization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Connecting the central and distributed teams is essential. In most places I’ve worked, we organized gatherings to facilitate regular alignments, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regular (e.g., bi-weekly) forums</strong>: Here, updates are shared, architectural spikes are announced, and decisions are debated.</li>
  <li><strong>Annual or bi-annual summits</strong>: These are the architecture equivalent of Comic-Con, with several days of intense knowledge sharing and workshops.</li>
  <li><strong>Ad-hoc workshops</strong>: These focus on specific topics and deep dives into niche subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the central team can provide essential support, all communities must take the initiative and get many people involved in these events. It’s crucial that people are <strong>active participants</strong> rather than passive spectators to ensure more engagement and commitment. So, get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive in, because architecture is a team sport, and everyone needs to play their part!</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="building-collaborative-networks">Building Collaborative Networks</h2>

<p>While each organization will need its unique approach, here are some tips I found helpful when forming architecture teams and building Collaborative Networks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before making grandiose plans for reorganizations, <strong>connect with the people already doing architectural work</strong> in an organization. Bring together all the critical tech leaders, regardless of their position and title. Being well-connected to these folks will be crucial in any architecture organization, so this effort is never wasted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If creating a virtual team is a part of your architecture strategy, move away from the informal community of practice and start <strong>building a team with more accountability and responsibility</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connect with non-architecture people</strong> early to gain broader support for building architecture teams and guilds. Being well-connected to these stakeholders is crucial to have strong collaborative networks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoid hiring <a href="https://architectelevator.com/transformation/dont-hire-hitman/">a digital hitman</a></strong>. Instead, invest in growing internal talent. Think of it this way: architects need to know the technology, the domain, and the organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Externalize</strong>. Reach out and connect. Participate in external events. Publish your work. Being strong externally can help you grow and attract architectural talent. Everyone wants to join the band when you’re rocking the stage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<p>It is difficult to overestimate the importance of people for an architecture practice, yet many organizations take architectural talent for granted. To reflect on the importance of carefully organizing, empowering, and leveraging scarce architecture talent, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Do you have a strong network of architects across the organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>Which central, federated, or hybrid model best represents your current an architecture practice? Why was this model chosen, and how effective has it been for your organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>If you are part of a central architecture team, how would you support the rest of the organization? How would you contribute to the global an architecture practice if you were part of a distributed virtual team?</em></li>
  <li><em>Consider having the roles of central architecture teams and federated architecture teams in your organization. How would they complement each other?</em></li>
  <li><em>How effective is the current division of responsibilities among architects in your organization? Are there areas of overlap or gaps in coverage?</em></li>
  <li><em>What steps has your organization taken to ensure architects are well-connected across all parts and levels? What impact has this had on transparency and the implementation of changes?</em></li>
  <li><em>Reflect on the diversity of team structures within your organization. How does this diversity impact the roles and responsibilities of architects?</em></li>

<p><br />
Each organization will have different architectural needs and contexts. When forming an architecture practice, I use as a starting point these <a href="https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/">two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Your architecture team’s job is to <strong>solve your biggest problems</strong>. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that.”</em></li>
  <li><em>“Your organization has to earn its way to an effective an architecture practice. <strong>You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess</strong> and expect it to solve all your problems.”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Considering Gregor Hohpe’s previous two points, I approach defining an architecture practice with the mindset that there is no one-size-fits-all method. You must find your own activities and operating models to enable architecture to solve the most critical problems.</p>

<div class="quote">
There is no one-size-fits-all approach: each organization must find activities and operating models that enable architecture to solve the most critical problems.
</div>

<p>No matter which operating models you select, it’s crucial to develop <strong>explicit agreements</strong> and “rules of engagement” with key stakeholders. This collaborative approach is essential to create a sustainable and practical an architecture practice.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-operating-model.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework: Operating Model.</em></p>

<p>This section outlines some lessons I learned when defining IT architecture operating models. The Operating Model (Figure 1) is a part of the Grounded Architecture framework that defines a set of <strong>processes and agreements</strong> that allow architects to do everything an architecture practice typically does. The model should leverage Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to develop a data-informed, organization-wide impact. Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks provide a basis for data-informed decision-making that is well-embedded in the organization.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="examples-of-architecture-activities">Examples of Architecture Activities</h2>

<p>An Operating Model enables a structured and strategic approach to an architecture practice within the organization.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-479875962.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/StockPlanets">BraunS</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

<p>Here are examples of the activities I have been engaged in with architects to provide a clearer understanding of what I mean by an operating model.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Designing Mechanisms for Teams to Make Better Decisions</strong>: These mechanisms involved creating global decision-support frameworks such as advisory forums facilitating informed discussions across teams. For compliance-sensitive projects, we establish formal design authorities. Additionally, we develop team-specific mechanisms, like escalation paths, to resolve decision conflicts effectively (e.g., when teams disagree on a common messaging middleware).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Teams in Their Daily Work</strong>: This support entailed integrating into key team activities and aligning architectural work with team rituals to provide timely support. We assisted teams during all critical phases, such as reviewing architecture proposals before the commencement of a project or sprint, ensuring alignment with overall architectural standards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Planned New Initiatives and Projects</strong>: Ensuring seamless alignment between projects that require multi-team collaboration is crucial. We worked to facilitate communication and coordination, ensuring all teams are on the same page regarding project goals and requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Teams in Dealing with the Legacy Landscape</strong>: We provided data and insights about the legacy landscape, identifying problematic areas such as frequently changed, low-quality, untested legacy code. We helped define scenarios and roadmaps for legacy modernization, ensuring a structured approach to updating and maintaining legacy systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tracking Tech Debt and Defining Tech Debt Reduction Programs</strong>: This involves creating a centrally aligned backlog of technical debt and defining programs for its reduction. We integrate these programs into the planning processes to ensure that tech debt is managed proactively and effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Performing SWOT and Other Analyses of Platforms and Systems</strong>: Conducting deep dives to understand specific areas of the technology landscape. We performed SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analyses and other assessments. These analyses helped in creating comprehensive plans and roadmaps for improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Standardizing Processes and Documentation</strong>: We defined standard templates for key documents such as Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), Technical Design Reviews (TDRs), and common diagrams. This standardization ensures consistency and clarity across all architectural documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A) Activities with Expertise and Analyses</strong>: We provided analyses, recommendations, and integration planning for mergers and acquisitions. Such support ensures that architectural considerations are well-integrated into M&amp;A activities, facilitating smoother transitions and integrations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defining Key Technology Strategies</strong>: We contributed to the development of essential technology strategies, including those for Cloud, Data, and Platforms. These strategies provide a clear roadmap for technological development and investment, ensuring alignment with business goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defining Vision and Direction of Technology</strong>: In collaboration with Engineering Leaders, we created a sustainable organizational setting that aligns with the overarching technology strategies. This work involved setting a clear vision and direction for the technology landscape within the organization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="guiding-principles-for-architectural-excellence-policies-autonomy-and-engagement">Guiding Principles for Architectural Excellence: Policies, Autonomy, and Engagement</h2>

<p>In this section, I address different guiding principles of architectural work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our <strong>operating framework</strong> always emphasizes a <strong>collaborative</strong> and <strong>supportive</strong> approach. Architects should empower development teams to make most decisions while ensuring strategic alignment and minimal compatibility. Architects should engage early in processes to <strong>avoid bureaucratic delays,</strong> focus on constant motion between daily support and strategic tasks, and use data to inform decisions.</li>
  <li>The <strong>distributed decision-making</strong> model promotes team autonomy complemented by high transparency and alignment, guided by principles that balance autonomy with global consistency.</li>
  <li>The “Golden Paths” concept enhances uniformity and efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="high-level-operating-framework">High-Level Operating Framework</h3>

<p>While exact activities and their scope will depend on an organization setting and will change over time, I usually followed a common operational framework in daily work inspired by Gregor Hohpe’s strategy-principles-decisions model (Figure 2).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Here are the key characteristics of this operating framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Architects engage with stakeholders and teams in a <strong>collaborative and supportive manner</strong>.</li>
  <li>Architects aim to <strong>empower the teams</strong> so that they make most of the decisions.</li>

  <li><strong>Bring relevant data</strong> to inform decisions leveraging <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Define decision boundaries</strong> to enable minimal compatibility and strategic alignment (e.g., golden paths or tech stack constraints).</li>
  <li><strong>Define fundamental principles</strong> to facilitate consistency in decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Share and generalize</strong> lessons learned via <a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social dynamics of architects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architects spend their time in <strong>constant motion</strong> between supporting teams’ <strong>daily work</strong> and working on <strong>strategic topics</strong>, helping the organization achieve alignment between strategy and implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shift left</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid <strong>formal bureaucratic approval</strong> processes, where architects appear too late and are frequently busy approving trivial decisions.</li>
  <li>Have architects <strong>involved early</strong> in any of the processes, such as during the planning and preparation stages, where it is possible to make more significant changes. Think of it as having the architects as early birds catching the architectural worms, making big changes before the day officially starts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="distributing-decisions-autonomy-and-alignment">Distributing Decisions, Autonomy, and Alignment</h3>

<p>With any operating model, I aim to keep architectural decision-making distributed across the organization and embedded in the development teams. Development <strong>teams traditionally have the best insights and most information</strong> relevant for making decisions. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, the worst case of organizational decision-making happens when people with relevant information are not allowed to make decisions, while people who lack sufficient information make all decisions. Grounded Architecture aims to make relevant information more readily available to a broader audience and better connect people when making decisions.</p>

</div>

<p>While I aim to create a mechanism to give teams autonomy, autonomy does not mean that teams are alone, do not align with anyone, do not get feedback from anyone, and do whatever they want. Teams must complement <strong>autonomy</strong> with high <strong>transparency</strong> and <strong>proactivity</strong> in alignment with other groups.</p>

<p>I have sometimes implemented the concept of a <strong>decision pyramid</strong> (Figure 3) to give the teams <strong>maximal autonomy</strong> while maintaining a <strong>minimal</strong> level of <strong>global alignment</strong> and compatibility.</p>

<p>The <strong>decision pyramid</strong> highlights that development teams should make most decisions. However, several strategic and area-level choices may provide team decision boundaries. For example, selecting the public cloud provider is typically a CTO-level strategic decision. Similarly, engineering leaders in some areas may want to limit some choices, such as the number of programming languages, to more easily train new people, maintain code, and support moves between teams.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/decision-pyramid.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A decision pyramid. The development teams should make most decisions. However, several strategic and area-level decisions may provide decision boundaries for teams (e.g., golden paths or tech stack constraints).</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="general-architecture-decision-policy">General Architecture Decision Policy</h3>

<p>Distributed decision-making scales well, but it can lead to chaos if entirely uncoordinated. Some decision policies are needed. Inspired by the famous <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr">Netflix expense policy</a></strong>, <em>“Act in Netflix’s best interests”</em>, I frequently argued that architecture decision policy could similarly be summarized in six words: <em>“Decide in the Organization’s Best Interests.”</em></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/decision-policy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I mean by that is that <strong>anyone can make architecture decisions</strong>, provided that, in addition to their specific requirements, they also think about the <strong>impact of their choices</strong> on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overall organizational complexity</strong>: Technology is more manageable by limiting tech diversity, size, and dependencies. Limiting technology choices reduces the attack surface with fewer third-party dependencies and tool ecosystems (build, testing, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of moving people</strong> between teams (both to get help and help others): Do not unnecessarily create exotic islands with few experts in technologies not supported or widely used in the organization. People cannot get help or move across the organization as their expertise may be useless outside the team.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of training and onboarding</strong> of internal and external developers: Using conventional technologies supported by external learning resources (e.g., books, tutorials) significantly helps find and grow experts.</li>
  <li><strong>Talent density</strong> and the possibility of performing at the world-scale level: Building world-scale technology and scaling requires in-depth knowledge and fine-tuning. You cannot achieve it with only a few in-house experts.</li>
  <li>New <strong>reorganizations</strong>: If the ownership of components changes (e.g., another team is taking it over), would your choices fit with other components from other areas?</li>
  <li>Reducing global <strong>duplication of effort</strong> and inefficiencies: Are you doing the work others are doing? Can others reuse your work? Can you reuse the work of others?</li>
</ul>

<p>While it may not always be enough, this simple policy can resonate well with many people and can encourage them to be more thoughtful when making decisions.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="golden-paths">Golden Paths</h3>

<p>I have found that the concept of Golden Paths provides an excellent ground to <strong>drive alignment and collaboration</strong> in architecture activities. Golden Paths is an approach utilized to streamline and unify the development process within a software ecosystem, aiming to tackle fragmentation and foster consistency, inspired by <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/">Spotify’s implementation</a>. Golden Paths can be described as “<strong>opinionated and supported</strong>” routes developers can follow to build systems efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p><img style="" src="assets/images/spotify-golden-paths_infrastructure-and-tooling-700x327.png" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Golden paths provide a solid <strong>foundation for aligning</strong> architecture activities, serving as a common target of work for Guilds and central architectural teams. Rather than being solely knowledge-sharing entities, <strong>guilds</strong> can be empowered to <strong>develop golden paths,</strong> serving as an excellent catalyst for more effective community engagement. This approach not only enhances the role of guilds but also increases the adoption of golden paths as they are created collaboratively.</p>

<p>Golden Paths can be crucial to an organization’s IT development landscape as a deliberate and strategic effort to promote <strong>uniformity,</strong> <strong>efficiency,</strong> and <strong>reliability.</strong> By advocating for a set of preferred technologies and practices that are <strong>well-supported,</strong> <strong>secure,</strong> and aligned with the organization’s broader objectives, Golden Paths can guide developers to build less fragmented, and faster-to-develop software. Ultimately, this leads to higher-quality and more maintainable IT systems.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="embracing-diversity">Embracing Diversity</h2>

<p>When building architecture guilds and virtual architecture teams, it’s crucial to acknowledge that organizational units have diverse structures and sizes. In big organizations, <strong>embracing diversity</strong> is a prerequisite to having a broad impact.</p>

</div>

<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution for assigning architecture responsibilities within departments. Based on Gregor Hohpe’s view of architects and their teams’ relationships, I’ve generally encountered three types of team-architect systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Benevolent “dictator”</strong>: An architect or architecture team tells developers what to do or how to do things. The key nuance here is whether the communication is unidirectional or bi-directional.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Primus inter pares (first among equals)</strong>: Architects are embedded within teams where each is just another team member, but with a focus on the system structure and trade-offs and taking a longer-term view than other team members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Architecture without architects</strong>: Architecture is done within teams, but the task is a shared responsibility among multiple (or all) team members. This approach is often the preferred model in modern technology organizations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, there is no magic bullet. Different structures work for various organizations; sometimes, the best solution is a mix of these approaches.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="setting-boundaries">Setting Boundaries</h2>

<p>One of the amusing challenges with setting up an architecture practice in an organization is that everyone seems to have a different idea of what “architecture” should entail. It’s like asking people to describe a unicorn: some imagine a mythical, majestic creature, while others picture a sparkly horse with a horn that grants wishes. Good architects can do many things, but this versatility might not always be the most effective way to support the organization. We need to <strong>set boundaries</strong> so that we can focus on what’s important rather than becoming frazzled by what’s not.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-92285726.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>To be effective, I’ve found it crucial to establish and clearly communicate some “<strong>rules of engagement</strong>” (ROE). Think of ROE as the office playbook for how architects should operate. In a corporate setting, ROE are the principles that guide how employees and departments interact with each other, clients, and stakeholders. This includes communication protocols, decision-making processes, and conflict-resolution mechanisms. Essentially, ROE sets the stage for what’s expected and what’s not, ensuring everyone plays nicely and fairly.</p>

<p>While you may need to tailor these rules to fit your organization, I found it helpful to set expectations for what the team should be able to do to qualify for the architecture support. Here’s a handy list of expectations for teams seeking architecture support. This also helps clarify what an architecture practice isn’t supposed to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organizational Awareness and Connections:</strong> Teams should know all relevant stakeholders and actively engage with them. This knowledge should include product, development, and business stakeholders. Planning should be collaborative across all affected teams, with active working relationships with global functions like QA, DevOps, or Security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enough Capacity and Skills:</strong> Teams should have adequate development capacity with the right skills and seniority to innovate and maintain their products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strategic Awareness:</strong> Teams should understand the organization’s strategic goals, technologies, and other relevant strategies, and know their role within these frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical Documentation Literacy:</strong> Teams should be capable of creating technical documentation, such as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) or RFCs (Request for Comments).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technology Standard Awareness:</strong> Teams should be familiar with the organization’s technology standards, including golden paths and guidelines for planning, documentation, security, DevOps, and QA processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Participation and Citizenship:</strong> Teams should actively participate in relevant communities (like architecture guilds) and global events (such as architecture summits).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tech Debt Management:</strong> Teams must be aware of the technical debt they create and maintain, ideally having a tech debt backlog and a plan for “paying” it back.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Aligning on these rules with the teams helps ensure productive conversations about architectural support. When these conditions are met, an architecture practice can help teams level up. When they’re not, architecture support can’t be as effective. However, that doesn’t mean struggling teams are left in the lurch. Architecture can help teams meet these expectations but can’t compensate for their total lack. Teams need to take the initiative and lead. For instance, it’s impractical to have architects working full-time for months with one team as their senior developer. However, architects can coach and help developers grow which is a more scalable appraoch. Similarly, architects can assist in building relationships with other teams, but the teams themselves need to be active and engaged.</p>

<p>So, set those expectations, establish your rules of engagement, and watch as your an architecture practice goes from a sparkly unicorn to a well-oiled machine!</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Here are <strong>five key points</strong> to consider when defining an architecture practice and its operating model within your organization:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No One-Size-Fits-All Architecture Practice</strong>:
Organizations must customize their architecture practices to address specific challenges and contexts. It’s ineffective to place architects in disarray and expect positive results—architecture should focus on resolving the organization’s most pressing issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborative and Distributed Operating Models</strong>:
Successful architectural work depends on collaboration with teams, distributed decision-making, and clearly defined “rules of engagement.” Architects should empower teams, get involved early, avoid bureaucratic delays, and ensure alignment with strategic goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Golden Paths and Standardization Promote Alignment</strong>:
“Golden Paths”—clear, opinionated, and supported solutions—are essential for reducing fragmentation, increasing consistency, and guiding teams toward efficient and aligned development practices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Architecture Activities Must Be Grounded and Strategic</strong>:
Important architecture activities include designing decision frameworks, supporting projects and legacy modernization, tracking technical debt, conducting platform analyses, and defining strategic technology directions—all while being integrated into team workflows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set Clear Expectations and Boundaries for Effective Support</strong>:
Architectural support is most effective when teams meet baseline criteria (e.g., stakeholder awareness, skills, documentation literacy). Establishing expectations and defining boundaries ensures that architectural efforts are scalable and focused on areas with the most significant impact.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your an architecture practice job is to solve the biggest problems in your organization. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How can you identify the most critical problems that your architects need to solve in your organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>What activities and operating models can you think of that will best enable architecture in your organization to work on these critical problems?</em></li>
  <li><em>What does the Operating Model look like in your organization, and how could it be improved?</em></li>
  <li><em>Which of the provided examples of architectural activities are you currently performing in your organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does the proposed common operating model align with your current operational practices in your organization? What changes might be necessary to adopt this model?</em></li>
  <li><em>In your experience, how early are architects involved in projects and activities? Do you agree with the goal of ‘shifting left’ the architecture work?</em></li>
  <li><em>How are architectural decisions distributed across your organization currently? How could this process be improved to ensure the people with the most relevant information make the decisions?</em></li>
  <li><em>How could you better implement a mechanism to give teams autonomy while maintaining alignment and compatibility with global strategy?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does the concept of a decision pyramid resonate with you?</em></li>

  <p><strong>IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:</strong>  Get an introduction to Six Simple Rules, a model for setting up organizational structures based on cooperation.</p>

  <p><strong>KEY POINTS:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Grounded Architecture emphasizes collaboration and aligns with the Six Simple Rules framework, which promotes autonomy and cooperation to manage organizational complexity effectively.</li>
    <li>The Six Simple Rules reject traditional hard and soft management styles, instead advocating for structures that empower people while encouraging mutual accountability and cooperation.</li>
    <li>Key rules include understanding actual work behaviors, reinforcing integrators, and increasing the total power in the organization to enable decision-making without creating bureaucracy.</li>
    <li>Cooperation is strengthened through reciprocity, feedback loops (“shadow of the future”), and rewarding collaborative behavior, creating a system where shared success drives performance.</li>
    <li>Architecture practices play a vital role by using tools like Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to support these rules and foster an adaptive, high-impact environment.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
The Grounded Architecture operating model is <strong>fundamentally collaborative</strong>. It focuses on establishing <strong>organizational structures based on cooperation</strong>, allowing architects to work effectively with others and make a meaningful impact. To foster such a collaborative approach, I have found the Six Simple Rules method, developed by Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman, to be particularly useful. This framework encourages organizations to adapt to complexity by promoting autonomy and cooperation among their members.</p>

<p>The book <em>Six Simple Rules: How to Manage Complexity Without Getting Complicated</em> by Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman has greatly influenced my vision of an architectural practice. The authors introduce the concept of <strong>Smart Simplicity</strong>, outlining six rules or strategies that enable organizations to encourage new behaviors and enhance performance. The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes that in today’s business environment, it is essential to create <strong>organizational structures based on cooperation</strong>.</p>

<div class="quote">
In today's complicated business environments, it is crucial to establish organizational structures that prioritize cooperation.
</div>

<p>Morieux and Tollman developed the Six Simple Rules as a practical solution for today’s complex business landscape. The rules in the book rest on the idea that effectively managing complexity requires a <strong>combination of autonomy and cooperation.</strong> They advocate for organizational structures that align with this principle, empowering individuals to act autonomously. This approach is rooted in trusting the skills and capabilities of the organization’s people to tackle complex challenges, thereby fostering a cooperative and efficient work environment.</p>

<p>In this chapter, I will explore how Grounded Architecture and the Six Simple Rules complement each other. The ideas from the Six Simple Rules have been a significant source of inspiration for my work. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html"><strong>Conway’s Law</strong></a> illustrates that the relationship between organizational structures and IT architecture is like peanut butter and jelly—stronger and better together. Both the Six Simple Rules approach and architectural practice focus on managing complexity without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="background-hard-and-soft-management">Background: Hard and Soft Management</h2>

<p>One of the Six Simple Rules’ central premises is that <strong>conventional management approaches</strong>, which the authors split into hard and soft, are neither sufficient nor appropriate for the complexity of organizations nowadays.</p>

<h3 id="hard-approach">Hard Approach</h3>

<p>The <strong>hard approach</strong> rests on two fundamental assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first is the belief that <strong>structures, processes, and systems</strong> have a direct and predictable effect on performance, and as long as managers pick the right ones, they will get the performance they want.</li>
  <li>The second assumption is that the <strong>human factor is the weakest and least reliable link</strong> of the organization and that it is essential to <strong>control people’s behavior through the proliferation of rules</strong> to specify their actions and through financial incentives linked to carefully designed metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to motivate them to perform in the way the organization wants them to.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the company needs to meet new performance requirements, the <strong>hard response</strong> is to <strong>add new structures, processes, and systems</strong> to help satisfy those requirements. Hence, introducing the innovation czar, the risk management team, the compliance unit, the customer-centricity leader, and the cohort of coordinators and interfaces have become so common in companies.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-936995400.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>In my experience, IT architecture support  in organizations following a hard management approach has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heavy Reliance on Tools:</strong> The architecture would focus on tools, automation, and workflows that <strong>enforce compliance,</strong> standardization, and control. There might be a strong reliance on enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, centralized data warehouses, and other structured tools that enable <strong>strict adherence</strong> to predefined processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> There would be a significant emphasis on <strong>compliance frameworks,</strong> security protocols, and risk management systems. These systems would be designed to ensure that all actions are traceable, compliant with regulations, and aligned with the company’s <strong>predefined rules and processes.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Bureaucratic Systems:</strong> The architecture might include multiple <strong>layers of control</strong> and coordination units, such as a risk management system, compliance databases, and innovation management software. Each of these units would be designed to enforce specific aspects of the organization’s performance objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="soft-approach">Soft Approach</h3>

<p>On the other end, we have a soft management approach. According to the <strong>soft approach</strong>, an organization is a set of <strong>interpersonal relationships and the sentiments</strong> that govern them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good performance is the by-product of good interpersonal relationships</strong>. Personal traits, psychological needs, and mindsets predetermine people’s actions.</li>
  <li>To change behavior at work, you need to <strong>change the mindset (or change the people)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1482584637.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>In my experience, IT architecture support in organizations following a soft management approach has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employee Empowerment:</strong> Systems would likely be designed to empower employees by providing the tools they need to <strong>succeed independently,</strong> such as access to real-time data, <strong>self-service</strong> analytics, and systems that encourage innovation and creativity.</li>
  <li><strong>Employee-Centric:</strong> The architecture would focus on tools facilitating communication and <strong>knowledge sharing.</strong> These tools might include <strong>collaboration platforms,</strong> social intranets, and user-friendly interfaces that enable employees to interact more effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Systems might be more personalized, offering <strong>customization options</strong> that align with individual preferences and needs. This personalization could include customizable dashboards and personalized workspaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="collaboration-approach">Collaboration Approach</h2>

<p>Hard and soft management approaches are limited in today’s world and are harmful to cooperation. A <strong>hard approach</strong> introduces <strong>complicated mechanisms</strong>, compliance, and “checking the box” behaviors instead of the engagement and initiative to make things work. The <strong>soft approach’s</strong> emphasis on <strong>good interpersonal feelings</strong> creates <strong>cooperation obstacles</strong> as people want to maintain good feelings.</p>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes that in today’s business environment, you must set up <strong>organizational structures based on cooperation</strong>. More specifically, the Six Simple Rules approach involves the interplay of <strong>autonomy</strong> and <strong>cooperation</strong>. The authors emphasize the critical difference between autonomy and self-sufficiency. <strong>Autonomy</strong> is about fully mobilizing our intelligence and energy to <strong>influence outcomes</strong>, including those <strong>we do not entirely control</strong>. <strong>Self-sufficiency</strong> is about <strong>limiting our efforts</strong> only to those outcomes that we <strong>control entirely without depending</strong> on others. Autonomy is essential for coping with complexity; <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> is an obstacle because it <strong>hinders the cooperation</strong> needed to make autonomy effective.</p>

<p>The first three rules create the conditions for <strong>individual autonomy and empowerment</strong> to improve performance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understand what your people do</strong>. Trace performance back to behaviors and how they influence overall results. Understand the context of goals, resources, and constraints. Determine how an organization’s elements shape goals, resources, and constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforce integrators</strong>. Identify integrators—those individuals or units whose influence makes a difference in the work of others—by looking for points of tension where people are doing the hard work of cooperating. Integrators bring others together and drive processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase the total quantity of power</strong>. When creating new roles in the organization, empower them to make decisions without taking power away from others.</li>
</ul>

<p>This difference between <strong>Autonomy</strong> and <strong>Self-Sufficiency</strong> leads us to the second set of rules that compels people to confront complexity and use their newfound autonomy to cooperate with others so that <strong>overall performance, not just individual performance</strong>, is radically improved.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase reciprocity</strong>. Set clear objectives that stimulate mutual interest to cooperate. Make each person’s success dependent on the success of others. Eliminate monopolies, reduce resources, and create new networks of interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Extend the shadow of the future</strong>. Have people experience the consequences that result from their behavior and decisions. Tighten feedback loops. Shorten the duration of projects. Enable people to see how their success is aided by contributing to the success of others.</li>
  <li><strong>Reward those who cooperate</strong>. Increase the payoff for all when they cooperate in a beneficial way. Establish penalties for those who fail to cooperate.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-1-understand-what-your-people-do">Rule 1: Understand What Your People Do</h2>

<p>The first rule states that you must genuinely understand performance: <strong>what people do</strong> and <strong>why they do it</strong>. When you know why people do what they do and how it drives performance, you can define the minimum sufficient set of <strong>interventions with surgical accuracy</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-understanding-performance">Guidelines for Understanding Performance</h3>

<p>To genuinely understand performance, consider the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trace performance back to behaviors, understanding how these behaviors influence and combine to produce overall results.</li>
  <li>Utilize observation, mapping, measurement, and discussion to gain insights.</li>
  <li>Comprehend the context of goals, resources, and constraints within which current behaviors are rational strategies for people.</li>
  <li>Discover how your organization’s elements—structure, scorecards, systems, and incentives—shape these goals, resources, and constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>Architecture practice can significantly aid in understanding organizational behaviors through:</p>

  <li>Establishing a <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> with an overview of various data sources to reveal where activities occur, visible trends, and cooperation among people.</li>
  <li>Utilizing the <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> to connect individuals and enable them to learn about activities in different parts of the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rule-2-reinforce-integrators">Rule 2: Reinforce Integrators</h2>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes the importance of reinforcing integrators by looking at those <strong>directly involved in the work</strong>, giving them <strong>power and interest to foster cooperation in dealing with complexity</strong> instead of resorting to the paraphernalia of overarching hierarchies, overlays, dedicated interfaces, balanced scorecards, or coordination procedures.</p>

<p>To strengthen integrators within your organization, consider these strategies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use emotions</strong> to identify candidates. Feelings provide crucial clues for analysis and can act as symptoms of integration issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Identify operational units</strong> that can be integrators among peer units due to their specific interests or power.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove managerial layers</strong> that do not add value and reinforce others as integrators by eliminating specific rules and relying on observation and judgment over metrics when cooperation is involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enhancing-integrators-through-architecture-practice">Enhancing Integrators Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can play a vital role in reinforcing integrators by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Utilizing the <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> to help identify and connect integrators, leveraging their work effectively.</li>
  <li>Emphasizing architects as critical integrators and integrator role models within the organization, defining them as essential components of the organizational “<a href="superglue">superglue</a>.”</li>
  <li>Establishing a <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> to support integrators with data and insights, enabling them to perform more informed and effective work.</li>

<h2 id="rule-3-increase-the-total-quantity-of-power">Rule 3: Increase the Total Quantity of Power</h2>

<p>Whenever you consider an <strong>addition to</strong> your organization’s <strong>structure, processes, and systems</strong>, think about <strong>increasing the quantity of power</strong>. Doing so may <strong>save you from increasing complicatedness</strong> and enable you to achieve a more significant impact with less cost. You can increase the quantity of power by allowing some functions to influence performance and stakes that matter to others.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-increasing-power-quantity">Guidelines for Increasing Power Quantity</h3>

<p>To enhance the quantity of power within your organization, consider these actions recommended by the Six Simple Rules approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When making design decisions that could shift the balance between central and unit power, functions, and line managers, ensure that some parts of the <strong>organization benefit from new power bases.</strong> This approach helps meet complexity requirements and avoids future disruptions from pendulum swings.</li>
  <li>When creating new functions, ensure they have the power to fulfill their roles <strong>without diminishing the power others need</strong> to fulfill theirs.</li>
  <li>When introducing new tools for managers, such as planning or evaluation systems, evaluate whether these tools <strong>act as resources or constraints.</strong> Implementing a few tools creates a critical mass of power, which is more effective than introducing many tools sequentially.</li>
  <li>Regularly <strong>enrich power bases</strong> to maintain agility, flexibility, and adaptability.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enhancing-power-quantity-through-architecture-practice">Enhancing Power Quantity Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can support the increase in power quantity through an operating model that promotes distributed decision-making:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Through the <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong>, you can enhance decision-making power by distributing architectural decision-making across the organization and embedding it within development teams, which typically have the best insights and most relevant information.</li>
  <li>Additionally, <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong>, accessible to all interested members of the organization, can provide data and insights that empower individuals in their daily work.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-4-increase-reciprocity">Rule 4: Increase Reciprocity</h2>

<p>In the face of business complexity, work is becoming more interdependent. To meet multiple and often contradictory performance requirements, <strong>people must rely more on each other</strong>. They need to <strong>cooperate directly</strong> instead of depending on dedicated interfaces, coordination structures, or procedures that only add to complicatedness.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-enhancing-reciprocity">Guidelines for Enhancing Reciprocity</h3>

<p>Reciprocity involves recognizing that people or units in an organization have a mutual interest in cooperation and that the success of one depends on the success of others. To foster this reciprocity, follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Eliminate monopolies</strong> to ensure no single entity has exclusive control.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce resources</strong> to encourage more efficient and collaborative use.</li>
  <li><strong>Create new networks</strong> of interaction to facilitate better communication and cooperation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enhancing-reciprocity-through-architecture-practice">Enhancing Reciprocity Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can significantly increase reciprocity within an organization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> supports creating new networks of interactions, directly reinforcing reciprocity.</li>
  <li>A <a href="operating-model">hybrid operating model</a> relies on the mutual success of an architecture practice and development teams. Architects’ <a href="impact">impact</a> is essential, and their support depends on the feedback from the groups they assist.

<h3 id="guidelines-for-extending-the-shadow-of-the-future">Guidelines for Extending the Shadow of the Future</h3>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach recommends four strategies to extend the shadow of the future:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tighten the feedback loop</strong> by increasing the frequency of moments when people experience the consequences of the fit between their contributions.</li>
  <li><strong>Bring the endpoint forward</strong> by shortening the duration of projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Tie futures together</strong> so that successful moves are conditioned on contributing to the success of others.</li>
  <li>Ensure people <strong>walk in the shoes they make</strong> for others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extending-the-shadow-of-the-future-through-architecture-practice">Extending the Shadow of the Future Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can play a crucial role in extending the shadow of the future through various methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> can create transparency and provide the data necessary to model the future. This data can be used to develop simulations and roadmap options.</li>
  <li>Applying <strong><a href="economics">economic modeling</a></strong> to architecture decision-making helps describe the future consequences of today’s actions, directly supporting long-term planning and decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-6-reward-those-who-cooperate">Rule 6: Reward Those Who Cooperate</h2>

<p>Lastly, the Six Simple Rules approach recommends that when you cannot create direct feedback loops embedded in people’s tasks, you need <strong>management’s intervention to close the loop</strong>. Managers must then use the familiar performance evaluation tool but in a very different way to reward those who cooperate.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-rewarding-cooperation">Guidelines for Rewarding Cooperation</h3>

<p>To effectively reward those who cooperate, managers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Go beyond technical criteria</strong> and avoid placing blame solely on where the root cause originated. Accept that execution problems arise from various reasons. The smart approach is to reduce rewards for those who <strong>fail to cooperate</strong> in solving a problem, even if the problem isn’t in their direct area, and increase rewards for units that cooperate beneficially.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid blaming failure</strong> and instead focus on blaming the inability to <strong>help or seek help.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Use simple questions</strong> to shift managerial conversations, making transparency and ambitious targets resources rather than constraints. This approach helps managers act as integrators, <strong>leveraging cooperation</strong> and rich information to achieve superior results.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rewarding-cooperation-through-architecture-practice">Rewarding Cooperation Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can facilitate rewarding cooperation by making it easier for individuals to help others and ask for help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A strong <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> can provide the context and networks necessary for easier collaboration.</li>
  <li>Adding diverse data sources to <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> can create transparency about cooperation opportunities and challenges, supporting a more collaborative environment.</li>

  <p><strong>KEY POINTS:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Architecture practice should support governance models adaptable to organizations’ complex and diverse needs. A technology governance model should be a well-balanced hybrid of three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.</li>
    <li>Nudging is a form of governing where you create subtle or indirect suggestions influencing someone’s behavior or decision-making without forcing them or limiting their freedom of choice.</li>
    <li>Governing with taxes (economic incentives) is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to “pay” some form of taxes on used resources.</li>
    <li>With mandates and bans, you guide people by explicitly defining what they should or should not do.</li>

<p><strong>Governance</strong> refers to the rules, practices, and processes that dictate how an organization is <strong>directed, managed, and held accountable</strong>. It clarifies who makes decisions, how they are made, and how the outcomes are monitored and enforced.</p>

<p>Governance extends beyond high-level board meetings; it is relevant across various areas of an organization, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Corporate governance</strong> – guiding leadership, accountability, and strategic direction.</li>
  <li><strong>IT governance</strong> – ensuring technology investments align with business goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Project governance</strong> – managing the execution of projects to align with strategic objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Data governance</strong> – ensuring data is accurate, secure, and responsibly used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every organization that utilizes technology has an IT architecture, which is the blueprint for how its systems, software, and infrastructure work together. However, <strong>IT architecture is more than technical diagrams; it is a form of governance</strong>.</p>

<p>IT architecture helps an organization to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Standardize</strong> systems and processes, thereby reducing complexity.</li>
  <li><strong>Align technology</strong> with business priorities and strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage risks</strong> related to security, compliance, and organizational change.</li>
  <li><strong>Utilize resources efficiently</strong>, avoiding waste and redundancy.</li>
  <li><strong>Support better decision-making</strong> by providing clear structures and insights.</li>
  <li><strong>Encourage innovation</strong> without sacrificing control.</li>
  <li><strong>Measure performance</strong> and facilitate continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, IT architecture translates governance principles into <strong>practical, everyday practices</strong> that bolster business success through technology.</p>

<p>Governance is not without its challenges. It often has to address:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conflicting priorities</strong> among departments or teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Rapid changes</strong> in technology, regulations, or customer needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex environments</strong> characterized by multiple systems, vendors, and stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p>For governance to be effective, it must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Adaptable</strong> – able to respond to evolving needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative</strong> – engaging diverse voices and perspectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic</strong> – balancing immediate demands with long-term visions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best governance frameworks are <strong>living systems</strong>; they evolve as the organization and its environment change.</p>

<p>Architecture, particularly in IT, should facilitate governance models that <strong>adapt to the complexity and diversity</strong> of the modern organization. One-size-fits-all approaches are rarely successful. Therefore, I advocate for a <strong>hybrid governance model</strong>—a thoughtful blend of different approaches tailored to specific situations.</p>

<p>This model incorporates three styles of influence:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Nudging</strong> – offering gentle guidance that influences behavior without restricting choice.</li>
  <li><strong>Taxes</strong> (or economic incentives) – rewarding positive behavior or discouraging harmful practices through resource allocation.</li>
  <li><strong>Mandates and bans</strong> – establishing clear rules and boundaries as necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these approaches plays a significant role. Together, they form a flexible and effective framework for managing how technology is employed and evolved within the organization.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="nudging-as-a-governance-tool">Nudging as a Governance Tool</h2>

<p>In behavioral economics and psychology, a <strong>nudge</strong> refers to a subtle cue or indirect suggestion that influences how people behave or make decisions—<strong>without coercing them or limiting their choices</strong>. The effectiveness of nudging lies in its gentle influence: it respects individual freedom while encouraging better choices through thoughtful design, context, and feedback.</p>

<p><br />
<img style="margin-top: -20px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1390608248.jpg" /></p>

Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/Chernetskaya">Liudmila Chernetska</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

<p>Nudges are frequently utilized in areas such as public policy, marketing, and workplace culture to assist individuals in making decisions that lead to better outcomes—both for themselves and for the system as a whole. Common examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Placing healthy food at eye level</strong> in cafeterias to encourage healthier eating habits.</li>
  <li><strong>Setting default options</strong> (e.g., opt-out organ donation) to promote socially beneficial behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Sending reminders</strong> or prompts to encourage timely actions, such as saving for retirement or updating software.</li>
</ul>

<p>This concept gained global attention through the book <strong><em>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</em></strong> by <strong>Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein</strong>. They also introduced the idea of <strong>choice architecture</strong>—how the structure and presentation of choices influence decision-making. By designing the environments in which decisions are made, we can gently guide behavior toward better outcomes, often overcoming common cognitive biases.</p>

<h3 id="nudging-in-it-architecture">Nudging in IT Architecture</h3>

<p>In the realm of <strong>IT architecture</strong>, nudging serves as a powerful, non-intrusive method to guide teams and individuals toward more consistent, efficient, and aligned behavior—<strong>without enforcing strict compliance</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are some ways nudging manifests in architectural practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Architectural principles</strong>:
Serve as soft guidelines rather than hard rules, subtly encouraging teams to align with broader strategic goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Best practice recommendations</strong>:
Promote reuse, consistency, and improved quality across teams while still allowing for autonomy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Golden paths</strong>:
Predefined, well-supported solutions or workflows that are the easiest to follow, gently guiding teams toward preferred technology choices. (<a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/">Spotify’s golden paths</a> are a strong example.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dashboards and visualizations</strong>:
Lightweight analytics platforms can highlight outdated or poor-quality software, applying social and reputational pressure for improvement without direct enforcement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical debt tracking</strong>:
Making technical debt visible raises awareness and nudges teams to address it over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cloud cost visualizations</strong>:
Demonstrating cost trends per team encourages behavior that leads to greater efficiency in cloud usage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These nudges are most effective when they are <strong>transparent, actionable, and connected to meaningful outcomes</strong>. They constructively influence behavior—helping people and teams make smarter decisions <strong>without the burden of top-down mandates</strong> or punitive enforcement.</p>

<p>The principles of <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> closely align with the concept of nudging. Instead of imposing rigid control, it creates environments that organically and collaboratively guide behavior. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> tools are designed to highlight areas that need improvement—acting as cues rather than commands.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> encourage peer learning and the dissemination of best practices through community influence and storytelling.</li>
  <li>The <strong><a href="operating-model">Operating Model</a></strong> promotes autonomous decision-making while integrating subtle mechanisms that <strong>nudge alignment</strong> with strategic goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these approaches create a governance strategy that is <strong>flexible, respects autonomy</strong>, and is <strong>highly effective</strong> in complex, dynamic organizational settings.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="taxation-economic-incentives-as-a-governance-mechanism">Taxation (Economic Incentives) as a Governance Mechanism</h2>

<p><strong>Taxation as governance</strong> is an approach that promotes accountability without imposing restrictions. Instead of prohibiting specific actions, it allows teams or departments to make their own decisions—but with <strong>a cost</strong>. This “cost,” or <strong>tax</strong>, is typically linked to the resources they consume. It creates a <strong>feedback loop</strong> that helps regulate behavior by making the consequences of excessive usage visible and tangible.</p>

<p>A common and effective example of this is found in <strong>managing cloud costs</strong>. In many organizations, departments consume public cloud services, such as storage, computation, and bandwidth. When these expenses are <strong>cross-charged</strong>—meaning each department pays for its share of usage—it sends a <strong>clear signal about resource consumption</strong>. Teams become more aware of their costs and are motivated to avoid waste and optimize efficiency.</p>

<p><br />
<img style="margin-top: -20px; width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover" src="assets/images/arch/credit-squeeze-g61ddead85_1920.png" /></p>

<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>This approach contrasts with <strong>nudging</strong>, which uses subtle design cues and informational guidance. Taxation, on the other hand, introduces <strong>direct, measurable consequences</strong>. For example, if a project consistently exceeds its allocated cloud budget, it may be <strong>delayed, reviewed, or even canceled</strong>. This adds a layer of accountability to resource use while still preserving team autonomy.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-architecture-in-a-taxation-model">The Role of Architecture in a Taxation Model</h3>

<p>The architecture practice plays a <strong>critical role</strong> in supporting this governance approach by ensuring that <strong>taxation mechanisms are fair, transparent, and data-driven</strong>. Key elements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transparent reporting</strong>:
All stakeholders must clearly understand how resource consumption is measured, how costs are allocated, and how these factors impact decision-making. This transparency builds trust and supports behavior change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Accurate, comprehensive data</strong>:
Taxation should be based on actual usage patterns, not estimates. Detailed cost reports—especially from public cloud environments—form the basis of meaningful economic incentives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Timely feedback loops</strong>:
Teams need <strong>real-time or near-real-time insights</strong> into their resource usage and associated costs. When feedback is delayed or unclear, the effectiveness of the tax diminishes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong>:
Tools like <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a> aggregate cloud cost data, visualize spending patterns, and help identify optimization opportunities. These analytics transform raw data into <strong>actionable insights</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborative Networks</strong>:
<a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a> align teams around shared goals, support the interpretation of analytics data, and facilitate the exchange of ideas for optimizing usage. They help foster a <strong>culture of responsible resource management</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="driving-sustainable-change">Driving Sustainable Change</h3>

<p>Ultimately, governing with taxes enables organizations to balance <strong>autonomy with accountability</strong>. It allows teams the freedom to make choices while making the <strong>impact of those choices visible</strong> through economic signals. When implemented effectively, this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encourages <strong>cost-conscious decision-making</strong>.</li>
  <li>Discourages <strong>wasteful or unsustainable use</strong> of shared resources.</li>
  <li>Promotes <strong>optimization and innovation</strong> within constraints.</li>
  <li>Strengthens alignment between <strong>financial accountability</strong> and <strong>technical architecture</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the right tools and structures in place—such as Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks—<strong>architecture practices become essential enablers</strong> of this governance style. They ensure that economic incentives are used wisely, feedback is timely, and resource consumption aligns with the organization’s long-term goals.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="mandates-and-bans-as-governance-tools">Mandates and Bans as Governance Tools</h2>

<p><strong>Mandates and bans</strong> are the most direct forms of governance. They clearly specify what people <strong>must do</strong> (mandates) or <strong>must not do</strong> (bans). These tools are essential for defining <strong>non-negotiable rules and boundaries</strong>, particularly in areas where compliance, ethics, or risk mitigation are crucial.</p>

<p>In practice, mandates and bans play a <strong>limited but vital role</strong> in shaping behavior. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A company may <strong>restrict the use of certain cloud providers</strong> to ensure data sovereignty or contractual compliance.</li>
  <li>Legal and regulatory mandates may <strong>require strong encryption</strong>, privacy protection, or specific financial reporting standards.</li>
  <li>Specific bans may <strong>prohibit risky technologies or architectural patterns</strong> that have proven unsustainable or insecure.</li>
</ul>

<p>While mandates and bans can be powerful, they should be used <strong>sparingly and intentionally</strong>. Overusing them may create unnecessary friction, discourage innovation, or diminish trust. However, in areas like <strong>security, compliance, and ethics</strong>, clear rules are not just helpful—they are essential. These rules help prevent incidents, safeguard the organization’s reputation, and <strong>ensure adherence to laws and regulations</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-architecture-in-enforcing-mandates-and-bans">The Role of Architecture in Enforcing Mandates and Bans</h3>

<p>In this governance model, the <strong>architecture practice serves as a contributor—not the sole authority</strong>. Mandates and bans are typically shaped collaboratively with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Security and risk teams</strong> to address vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal and regulatory departments</strong> to adhere to external obligations.</li>
  <li><strong>Operations and finance</strong> to enforce constraints related to costs or performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The architecture team’s role is to <strong>clarify, document, and reinforce</strong> these mandates through guidance, tooling, and visibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong>:<br />
<a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a> helps identify areas that require monitoring or enforcement. It can surface security vulnerabilities, policy violations, or infrastructure risks through dashboards and reports—creating <strong>transparency and focus</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborative Networks</strong>:<br />
<a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a> are essential for the <strong>socialization and adoption</strong> of mandates. They help explain the reasoning behind new rules, build consensus, and foster acceptance. These networks ensure that changes are <strong>well-communicated, understood, and internalized</strong>—not just enforced.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-and-how-to-use-mandates-and-bans">When and How to Use Mandates and Bans</h3>

<p>Mandates and bans are best reserved for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Critical compliance needs</strong> (e.g., GDPR, financial regulations)</li>
  <li><strong>Organizational priorities</strong> (e.g., sustainability, cybersecurity)</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic constraints</strong> (e.g., vendor lock-in, architectural standards)</li>
</ul>

<p>They work most effectively when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stakeholders are <strong>engaged early in the process</strong>.</li>
  <li>There is <strong>clear, data-driven justification</strong>.</li>
  <li>Communication is <strong>open, empathetic, and thorough</strong>.</li>
  <li>There are <strong>mechanisms to track adherence and measure impact</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Governing with mandates and bans involves setting <strong>firm, transparent boundaries</strong>, but this should be done with care. This governance tool is best employed when other methods (like nudging or taxation) are insufficient to ensure compliance, protect the organization, or uphold its values.</p>

<p>When thoughtfully implemented, and supported by clear analytics and strong collaboration, mandates and bans can become <strong>protective measures</strong>, not roadblocks—<strong>enabling safe innovation</strong> within a framework of trust and responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>What are the key components of the governance model in your organization, and how do mandates, taxes, and nudging influence them?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does your organization currently handle mandates and bans? Are they explicit and aligned with the overall technology strategy?</em></li>
  <li><em>How effective is the enforcement of these mandates and bans in your organization? Could improvements be made to create clarity and provide transparency?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does your organization approach taxation as a form of governance? Is it transparent, data-driven, and efficient?</em></li>
  <li><em>Can you identify any examples of ‘nudging’ in your current architectural environment? How effective are these subtle suggestions in influencing behavior or decision-making?</em></li>
  <li><em>How does your organization promote best practices and align around them? Are there any ‘golden paths’ for technology choices?</em></li>
  <li><em>How are your organization’s tech debt and the cost trends of cloud services tracked and visualized? Do these methods create enough awareness to stimulate improvement?</em></li>
  <li><em>How could you better utilize nudging to improve organizational decision-making? What biases or barriers to effective decision-making could you target with this approach?</em></li>

The technological landscape is undergoing a shift, driven largely by the rapid maturation and proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI). These powerful models, capable of creating novel content spanning text, code, images, and complex designs, are moving beyond experimental phases and demonstrating tangible potential to disrupt industries and reshape business operations<sup>1</sup>. Within the enterprise, the potential impact on IT and Enterprise Architecture (EA) practices is particularly profound<sup>5</sup>. Architects have long grappled with the paradox of guiding dynamic, evolving enterprises using tools and processes that are often static, fragmented, and slow<sup>5</sup>. GenAI offers the tantalizing prospect of augmenting architectural capabilities, automating tedious tasks, and enabling more dynamic, data-informed decision-making.</p>

<p>However, simply applying GenAI tools without a coherent framework risks amplifying existing complexities or introducing new ones. This report focuses on the intersection of GenAI with IT Architecture.</p>

<p>Grounded Architecture principles are particularly well-suited to harness the power of GenAI while mitigating some of its inherent risks. This report aims to provide IT and Enterprise Architects with a comprehensive analysis of how GenAI can be effectively and responsibly integrated into the Grounded Architecture framework. It will explore relevant GenAI capabilities, identify specific integration points and use cases, evaluate the potential benefits and challenges, propose best practices for responsible adoption, and examine future trends shaping this evolving landscape. The objective is to equip architects with the knowledge to leverage GenAI not just as a tool, but as a strategic enabler within a principled architectural practice.</p>

<h2 id="generative-ai-capabilities-for-the-modern-architect">Generative AI Capabilities for the Modern Architect</h2>

<p>GenAI represents a class of AI systems trained on vast datasets to generate new, realistic artifacts – including text, software code, images, designs, and more – that reflect the characteristics of the training data without simply repeating it<sup>1</sup>. Unlike traditional AI focused on analysis or prediction, GenAI creates<sup>2</sup>. Often interacting via natural language prompts, these models offer a suite of capabilities relevant to architects<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<h3 id="core-capabilities-relevant-to-it-architecture">Core Capabilities Relevant to IT Architecture:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Content Generation &amp; Augmentation:</strong> Drafting reports, technical documentation, emails, meeting summaries, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)<sup>1</sup>, code snippets<sup>1</sup>, and initial diagrams<sup>5</sup>. Large Language Models (LLMs) are key<sup>5</sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>Analysis &amp; Pattern Recognition:</strong> Analyzing large volumes of data (including unstructured text) to identify architectural anti-patterns, security vulnerabilities, technical debt indicators<sup>5</sup>, or convert diagram images to structured models<sup>5</sup>. Crucial for Lightweight Architectural Analytics.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation &amp; Efficiency:</strong> Automating documentation generation<sup>2</sup>, routine code review checks<sup>16</sup>, standard report generation<sup>2</sup>, requirements analysis assistance (summarization, extraction)<sup>10</sup>, and initial solution brainstorming<sup>21</sup>.</li>

<h3 id="the-role-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag">The Role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</h3>

<p>A critical enabling technology for enterprise GenAI is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)<sup>5</sup>. Standard LLMs generate responses based solely on their training data.<sup>28</sup> RAG enhances this by retrieving relevant, real-time information from specified external knowledge bases (internal documents, databases, EA repositories) first.<sup>28</sup> This retrieved context is then fed to the LLM along with the original prompt, grounding the response in specific, current, and authoritative enterprise information.<sup>29</sup></p>

<p><strong>Importance for IT Architecture:</strong> RAG is essential for making GenAI trustworthy and useful in IT Architecture.<sup>6</sup> It ensures AI outputs are based on the organization’s actual landscape, policies, and data, improving accuracy, relevance, and reducing “hallucinations”.<sup>29</sup> It directly supports Grounded Architecture’s data-driven ethos by connecting GenAI to verified enterprise knowledge.</p>

<p>The true potential arises from converging these capabilities, such as using analysis to find tech debt,<sup>36</sup> RAG to retrieve standards,<sup>28</sup> and generation to draft remediation ADRs<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="navigating-the-challenges-risks-and-limitations">Navigating the Challenges: Risks and Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accuracy and Reliability (Hallucinations):</strong> GenAI can generate incorrect, nonsensical, biased, or fabricated outputs<sup>1</sup>. Requires rigorous human validation, offsetting time savings<sup>1</sup>. Enterprise reliability is a hurdle.<sup>25</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Security and Data Privacy:</strong> Feeding proprietary data into GenAI models (esp. public cloud) risks leakage, unauthorized access, or misuse for training.<sup>14,65</sup> Requires strict access controls (user identity, not broad permissions<sup>67</sup>), encryption, data residency checks.<sup>31</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Ethical Considerations and Bias:</strong> Models can reflect/amplify biases from training data, leading to unfair or problematic outputs<sup>1</sup>. Requires proactive bias detection and mitigation.<sup>65</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright:</strong> Evolving legal landscape regarding ownership of AI outputs and potential infringement risks from training data.<sup>11</sup> Lack of verifiable IP protection assurances.</li>
  <li><strong>Need for Human Oversight and Judgment:</strong> GenAI augments, not replaces, architect’s critical thinking, context understanding, and strategic judgment<sup>5</sup>. Over-reliance (automation bias<sup>72</sup>) leads to poor outcomes. Human expertise is essential.<sup>60</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Cost and Resource Intensity:</strong> Implementation can be expensive (compute resources, GPUs, expertise).<sup>14,35</sup> Inference costs can be substantial.<sup>74</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Latency and Performance:</strong> Real-time applications can suffer latency. Complex generation/analysis takes time, potentially impacting UX or hitting limits.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration Complexity:</strong> Integrating GenAI into existing EA toolchains/workflows is non-trivial (APIs, data pipelines, prompt engineering, RAG context, orchestration).<sup>14,35</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Model Limitations and Context Window:</strong> Finite context window limits processing large inputs.<sup>25</sup> Models may struggle with novelty, complex reasoning, or truly innovative designs beyond known patterns.<sup>73</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Data Quality Dependency:</strong> “Garbage in, garbage out.” AI (esp. RAG) reliability depends heavily on the quality, accuracy, consistency, and accessibility of grounding data sources.<sup>14,34</sup> Poor data governance poisons results.<sup>34</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits and risks are often intertwined (e.g., speed vs. accuracy, data synthesis vs. privacy). Realizing benefits requires active risk management through governance, ethics, and human oversight.</p>

<h2 id="the-evolving-landscape-future-of-genai-in-enterprise-architecture">The Evolving Landscape: Future of GenAI in Enterprise Architecture</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Towards Real-Time, Augmented EA:</strong> Shift from periodic documentation to dynamic, “living” EA<sup>5</sup>. AI agents monitor digital signals, updating models/graphs<sup>5</sup>. Architects become “augmented architects” using AI as “cognitive prosthetics” or “copilots” for real-time navigation and decision-making<sup>5</sup>. Lightweight Architecture Analytics as an EA repository becomes an “operating system for change”<sup>5</sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>Rise of Agentic AI:</strong> Systems with greater AI autonomy performing complex, multi-step tasks (reasoning, planning, tool use, learning) with minimal human input.<sup>82,63</sup> Potential EA uses: continuous governance checks<sup>5</sup>, proactive architectural drift detection/remediation, impact simulation, workflow optimization<sup>5</sup>. Possibility of “self-optimizing organizations”.<sup>60</sup> Introduces new risks (control, security).<sup>63</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Digital Twins of Organizations (DTOs):</strong> Dynamic, data-rich digital replicas of operations, processes, systems,<sup>60</sup> fueled by real-time data and AI/GenAI for simulation, prediction, “what-if” analysis.<sup>60</sup> Resonates with Grounded Architecture goal of complete, current understanding. Examples: BMW, UPS.<sup>49</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Increased Democratization and Collaboration:</strong> Intuitive AI tools (NLP interfaces, auto-visualizations) make architectural insights accessible to broader stakeholders<sup>5</sup>. Chatbots querying EA repos<sup>5</sup> or AI reports<sup>26</sup> strengthen Grounded Architecture’s Collaborative Networks.</li>
  <li><strong>Composable and Modular AI Architectures:</strong> Emphasis on flexible AI system architectures allowing easy integration/swapping of components (LLMs, vector DBs, RAG modules, agents) due to rapid innovation.<sup>74</sup> Aligns with Grounded Architecture’s Adaptability principle.</li>
  <li><strong>Evolving Role of the Architect:</strong> Shift towards higher-level functions: governing AI use, designing ethical guardrails, curating data/models, ensuring business alignment, facilitating collaboration, applying critical thinking to AI outputs<sup>5</sup>. Emergence of roles like “Enterprise AI Architect”.<sup>60</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Vertical AI Specialization:</strong> Continued trend of AI solutions tailored for specific industries (healthcare, finance).<sup>4</sup> Requires architects to understand domain-specific AI.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Grounded Architecture’s Future:</strong> Grounded Architecture principles (data-driven, adaptability, collaboration, pragmatism) remain resilient and relevant. Its data emphasis supports AI grounding; collaborative networks support ethical governance; adaptive operating model incorporates AI tools. Grounded Architecture seems well-positioned to leverage future AI trends.</p>

<p>These trends suggest faster feedback loops within the Grounded Architecture framework: near-instantaneous Lightweight Analytics via AI monitoring; rapid synthesis/dissemination of insights in Collaborative Networks; more dynamic Operating Model responses via AI analysis/recommendations. This enhances EA agility, responsiveness, and strategic value under Grounded Architecture principles.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="architecting-the-future-with-genai-and-grounded-principles">Architecting the Future with GenAI and Grounded Principles</h2>

<p>Generative AI offers transformative potential for architects, augmenting capabilities, automating tasks, and deriving deeper insights. Within the Grounded Architecture framework, GenAI can amplify core pillars: accelerating Lightweight Architectural Analytics, enhancing Collaborative Networks, and streamlining the Operating Model. Use cases demonstrate practical value, while benefits like efficiency, consistency, better decision support, collaboration, and innovation align with Grounded Architecture tenets.</p>

<p>Realizing this requires navigating significant challenges: accuracy, security, privacy, ethics, bias, cost, and complexity. Benefits and risks are intertwined, necessitating diligent governance and risk management. GenAI is an augmentation tool, not a replacement;<sup>5</sup> human judgment, critical thinking, ethics, and collaboration skills remain paramount and become even more valuable as the architect’s role evolves towards governing AI and strategic application.</p>

<p>The Grounded Architecture framework, emphasizing data, collaboration, adaptability, and pragmatism, provides a robust foundation for responsible and effective GenAI adoption, supporting best practices like data governance, stakeholder engagement, and oversight.</p>

<p>Architects embracing Grounded Architecture should:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment Pragmatically:</strong> Start with clear value, manageable risk use cases aligned with Grounded Architecture activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize Responsibility:</strong> Embed ethics, security, privacy, fairness from the start, using the Grounded Architecture structure for governance.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Grounding:</strong> Use RAG and high-quality enterprise data for relevant, trustworthy outputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain Human Centrality:</strong> Design workflows with human oversight; empower, don’t supplant architects.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuously Learn:</strong> Stay abreast of GenAI evolution (agentic AI, DTOs) and adapt practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The confluence of human expertise, the Grounded Architecture framework, and GenAI power offers a path to more adaptive, data-informed, efficient, and resilient enterprises. By embracing GenAI thoughtfully within this grounded context, architects can elevate their impact and shape an intelligent technological future.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br />
Have you ever wondered how to run an IT architecture practice without <strong>feeling stuck in an ivory tower?</strong> Look no further! This book will share an approach to running an IT architecture practice in larger organizations based on my experience at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta. I call it “Grounded Architecture”—because it’s all about having your feet on the ground and your <strong>architecture firmly planted in reality.</strong></p>

<p>The approach presented in this book connects architecture to every nook and cranny of your organization, making sure you’re not a lone wizard in a tower casting spells that no one understands. Grounded Architecture prioritizes connections with people and data over fancy theories, processes, and tools. The books will offer you new insight into IT architecture, redefining it as an <strong>adaptable</strong> and <strong>outcome-oriented</strong> practice.</p>

<p>The name “Grounded Architecture” is a hat-tip to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory">Grounded Theory</a> methodology. Grounded Theory is about developing theories from the data you gather from the real world rather than pulling them out of thin air. Likewise, Grounded Architecture evolves from honest feedback and data, not from dusty old books of abstract principles.</p>

<h2 id="grounded-architecture-overview">Grounded Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>This book breaks down Grounded Architecture into two main parts (Figure 1):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework:</strong> The nuts and bolts you need to get your Grounded Architecture practice up and running.</li>
  <li><strong>Guiding Principles:</strong> Handy tips and inspirations to help you bring these ideas to life.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/model.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong>  Grounded Architecture Overview.</em></p>

<p><br />
Grounded Architecture framework consists of three elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="operating-model">Operating Model</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></em> keeps your architecture decisions based on up-to-date and complete information about your organization’s tech landscape.</p>

<p><em><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></em> represents a strong network of people working on architecture across your organization, ensuring your efforts make a difference.</p>

<p>Lastly, the sections <em><a href="operating-model">Operating Model: General Principles</a></em>, <em><a href="six-simple-rules">Cooperation-Based Operating Model</a></em>, and <em><a href="governance">IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates</a></em> define a collection of processes and agreements that lets architects do their thing, leveraging data and people connections to create a powerful, organization-wide impact.</p>

<p>As part of my Grounded Architecture quest, I’ve devised several guiding principles and tools to help you sprinkle Grounded Architecture magic in your practice. While traditional IT architecture literature often zeros in on technical know-how, this collection dares you to think differently about IT architecture and to dive into the rich insights of social, behavioral, and management sciences. These resources are grouped into several parts and are sure to make your journey both insightful and entertaining:</p>

</ul>

<p>If all this is not enough, in the online appendix I outline several resources that have proven vital in my journey as an IT architect. I routinely refer back to them and carry them in my practitioner “backpack,” so I added their summaries in the online <a href="appendix">appendix</a>, including:</p>

<p>The rest of this book will explain the Grounded Architecture approach in detail. In this section, I want to share a few things about my motivation to write this book.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-you-learn">What Will You Learn?</h2>

<p>This books serves as a guideline to build and <strong>operate a robust IT architecture practice,</strong> ensuring alignment with organizational goals while adapting to the challenges of modern IT environments.</p>

<h3 id="key-topics">Key Topics</h3>

<p>The book will provide you with tips and inspirations about work that you need to set up and run a modern IT architecture practice, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create flexible organizational and technical <strong>structures</strong> to  support IT architecture work,</li>
  <li>Define IT <strong>architecture roles</strong> and responsibilities, skills, and career paths,</li>
  <li>Operate an <strong>effective IT architecture practice</strong> in complex multicultural organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also provide a number of other ad-hoc lessons and inspirations from my work.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>I have organized my lessons and insights in a form that, if you recognize the problems and are inspired by solutions, could use as a <strong>high-level “playbook”</strong> about how to work as an architect or run an architecture practice. I also provide more concrete tips on each discussed topic, finishing each section with questions you should consider when addressing these topics.</p>

<p>I invite you to read this book from <strong>beginning to end</strong>, following the progression from data and basic structures to management and organizational topics. However, you can <strong>also browse the text</strong> and start reading whatever interests you. I use many <strong>illustrations</strong> to create easy-to-remember pictures that you can associate with discussed topics, making the book usable across your organization as a <strong>coffee table book</strong>, serving as an inspiration, or sparking discussions.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>This book is <strong>not technical</strong>. We will not discuss the details of public cloud design patterns, security, reliability, how to optimize computer loads, or select the proper data storage. As a modern architect, you will need these skills, but there are already many great resources. This book is about <strong>expanding your horizons</strong> to apply your technical skills in complex organizations. You can broaden your horizons as a head or manager of architects and organize and support architects to use their technical skills more effectively as a team.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-a-proven-method">Is This A Proven Method?</h3>

<p>Like with many similar books, you may be disappointed if you are looking for a scientifically proven “method” of running a modern an architecture practice. This book is <strong>personal and opinionated</strong>, building on my daily experiences as an architect and head of an architecture practice. While subjective, this book can provide valuable insights for IT architects, their managers, and people working with architects. I have successfully <strong>applied my approach in three different companies</strong>, which gives it some generality and repeatability.</p>

<p>I invite others to share the lessons they have learned similarly. Even if opinionated and limited in scope, such practical reflections based on concrete examples have much more value for practitioners than abstract debates, formal methods, or academic analyses.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who Should Read This Book?</h3>

<p>When writing this book, I had a broad audience in mind. The articles should be helpful to both technical and non-technical people. The book can help IT architects better understand their value and place in a broader organization. I also hope the articles show the wider audience the benefits of staying close to and well-connected with architects.</p>

<h3 id="applying-ideas-in-practice">Applying Ideas In Practice</h3>

<p>I approach designing an architecture practice in complex organizations as an <strong>art of cooking.</strong> A modern IT architecture practice is like a master chef’s kitchen. As you will always work with many local ingredients, you can’t just copy a recipe from one restaurant to another and expect it to taste the same.</p>

<p>This book shares some tasty tips and savory secrets on “cooking” up a thriving an architecture practice. But remember, <strong>every kitchen is different.</strong> Some ingredients and recipes are essential, while others might be left on the shelf. And don’t be surprised if you need to add a pinch of something special from other sources to spice things up.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1409729992.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>When I start an architecture practice, I see myself as a chef stepping into a new restaurant with a suitcase full of favorite spices. I blend in core preferred elements and foundational frameworks like a chef using their trusty spices and kitchen tools. But the <strong>authentic flavor</strong>—the magic that makes a dish unforgettable—comes from the <strong>local ingredients.</strong> In an organization, these local ingredients are the people: the in-house talent and culture that give the enterprise its unique taste.</p>

<p>While fundamental structures and practices may be consistent across diverse businesses, the most crucial elements—akin to fresh, <strong>local ingredients</strong> in cooking—you must procure locally. The staff’s skills, experiences, and insights are the secret ingredients that personalize and refine the architecture to align with specific business needs and goals. They are what render the architecture truly unique and effective.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-rigid-frameworks-it-architecture-as-an-adaptable-outcome-oriented-practice">Beyond Rigid Frameworks: IT Architecture As an Adaptable Outcome-Oriented Practice</h2>

<p>In this book, I will use the terms <strong>IT architecture</strong> and <strong>IT architects</strong> in a broad sense. I don’t adhere to strict divisions between enterprise, solution, technical, or software architecture, nor do I narrowly define roles such as enterprise architects, solution architects, or Staff+ technical leaders like principal engineers. Instead, I view IT architecture as a <strong>cohesive function</strong>—a bridge connecting technology, business, product, and organizational strategy. IT architecture is more than a set of duties; it serves as essential connective tissue, aligning these domains to work harmoniously.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1376008059.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="grounding-and-empowerment">Grounding and Empowerment</h3>

<p>Rather than advocating for rigid role distinctions, I propose <strong>rethinking and empowering these roles</strong> with an <strong>outcome-oriented, data-informed perspective,</strong> where each role is adaptable and focused on delivering value and impactful outcomes that align with the organization’s broader goals. This book emphasizes <strong>grounding</strong> your architecture in the organization with data, people connections, and pragmatic operating principles. You do not necessarily need to change your architecture team or roles to benefit from this grounding.</p>

<p>I believe IT architecture <strong>isn’t one-size-fits-all</strong>; it adapts to each company’s context, spanning strategic guidance, system integration, solution design, technical implementation, or hands-on leadership. This <strong>adaptability</strong> makes architecture both <strong>powerful and relevant,</strong> enabling architects to align with business goals while remaining responsive to technological change.</p>

<p>In some organizations, architecture may emphasize <strong>business alignment,</strong> ensuring technology investments support the mission. In others, it might focus on <strong>technical depth,</strong> where architects closely collaborate with engineering to build robust, scalable systems. Despite these variations, the core function remains: architecture guides coherence in complex ecosystems. For this reason, I consider IT architects anyone performing this bridging work, regardless of their title.</p>

<p>Focusing on architecture as an <strong>integrative and adaptable function</strong> allows us to appreciate the unique contributions of each architectural role. Rather than defining roles rigidly, this approach highlights architecture as a continuous, evolving practice that balances immediate technical needs with <strong>long-term strategic vision.</strong> This perspective empowers architecture to drive sustainable growth, adaptability, and innovation across the business.</p>

<h3 id="accepting-challenges">Accepting Challenges</h3>

<p>This broader view of IT architecture, while robust and integrative, presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional frameworks with well-defined roles and responsibilities, my perspective <strong>requires constant adaptation</strong> to evolving organizational needs. Traditional frameworks bring clarity and stability, outlining roles and providing structured pathways, making it easier to align efforts across a project’s lifecycle.</p>

<p>In contrast, an adaptive, integrative view of architecture is <strong>less rigid</strong> and <strong>more attuned</strong> to a company’s specific, shifting needs. This flexibility allows architects to bridge technology, business, product, and strategy holistically, responsive to change. However, IT architects and technical leaders must continually <strong>evaluate and recalibrate</strong> their approach. This evolution might mean adjusting priorities, balancing high-level strategy with hands-on guidance, and frequently engaging with stakeholders to ensure alignment.</p>

<p>I believe deeply in this approach, though I acknowledge its demands. It calls for <strong>insight</strong> into business and technology, a readiness to <strong>embrace ambiguity,</strong> and the ability to make decisions amid shifting priorities. IT architects working within this model need a strong grasp of the company’s vision and an <strong>acute sense of timing</strong>—knowing when to emphasize strategy or technical details. It requires agility, resilience, and the willingness to pivot as needs shift and to challenge assumptions to serve the business.</p>

<p>While challenging, this adaptive model of architecture offers rewards that traditional frameworks may lack. By not confining architects to strict roles, it enables solutions genuinely aligned with the organization’s mission, fostering closer collaboration and responsiveness to new opportunities or challenges. This flexibility ultimately allows architecture to drive lasting value and growth—creating a foundation that supports both current goals and future innovation.</p>

<h2 id="key-influences">Key Influences</h2>

<p>The Grounded Architecture approach also builds on many ideas that others have successfully used. Gregor Hohpe’s <a href="https://architectelevator.com/"><strong>Architecture Elevator</strong></a> view of architecture has heavily inspired my work. In many ways, my work reflects the lessons learned from implementing Gregor’s ideas in practice. Gregor described modern architects’ functions as aligning organization and technology, reducing friction, and charting transformation journeys. Such modern architects ride the Architect Elevator from the penthouse, where the business strategy is set, to the engine room, where engineers implement enabling technologies.</p>

<p>In my quest to define modern architectural roles, I used Staff+ Engineering jobs as an inspiration for the development of architects. Tanya Reilly’s book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/"><strong>The Staff Engineer’s Path</strong></a> and Will Larson’s book <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/"><strong>Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track</strong></a> are helpful guides in defining the responsibilities of modern architects. Overall, the Staff-plus engineering roles provide excellent examples for the development of architects.</p>

<p>Many other sources have influenced my work. You can find them in the online <a href="https://grounded-architecture.io/bookshelf">Bookshelf appendix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-book">Why This Book?</h2>

<p>This book <strong>generalizes my experiences</strong> in written form. I have written these articles for several reasons. Firstly, writing helps me clarify and improve my ideas (Figure 2). As Gregor Hohpe once noted, every sentence you write frees up brain cells to learn new things.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/writing.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Writing a book helped me organize ideas, obtain new insights, improve principles and tools, and share the lessons learned.</em></p>

<p>I also needed this book for the <strong>education of architects</strong> and to <strong>increase awareness about modern an architecture practices</strong> in organizations I worked in. Having written content can significantly help to spread the message. As nicely described by Hohpe written word has distinct advantages over the spoken word:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it scales: you can address a broad audience without gathering them all in one (virtual) room at the same time</li>
  <li>it’s fast to process: people read 2-3 times faster than they can listen</li>
  <li>it can be easily searched or versioned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, by generalizing and putting my experiences on paper, I aim to create more <strong>usable materials to help others</strong> in similar situations. I also expect helpful feedback from a broader community.</p>

<h2 id="a-part-of-the-bigger-picture-a-trilogy-in-four-parts">A Part of the Bigger Picture: A Trilogy in Four Parts</h2>

<p>This book is a part of the <a href="https://obren.io/"><strong>collection of open-source tools and resources</strong></a> I have built to help me in architectural work (Figure 3).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/obren_io_vertical.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Grounded Architecture is a part of the collection of open-source tools and resources I have built in the past ten years to help me in architectural work.</em></p>

<p>The other resources include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sokrates.dev"><strong>Sokrates</strong></a>: an open-source polyglot source code analysis tool. Sokrates provides a pragmatic, inexpensive way to extract rich data from source code repositories. Sokrates can help you understand your code by making the size, complexity, and coupling of software, people interactions, and team topologies visible.</li>
  <li><a href="https://obren.io/tools"><strong>Productivity Tools</strong></a>: A collection of more than 100 online tools I built to help me in my daily work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.obren359.com/"><strong>359° Overview of Tech Trends</strong></a> is my collection of knowledge resources with podcasts and videos from over 20 authoritative, high-quality sources (IEEE, ACM, GOTO Conf, SE Radio, Martin Fowler’s site, Ph.D. Theses). Architects need to learn fast, and finding good knowledge sources is difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more details about these tools on my homepage <strong><a href="https://obren.io/">obren.io</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-personal-history">A Bit of Personal History</h2>

<p>The work presented in this book builds on <strong>several years of my experience</strong>. Most of this work originates from my current work as a <strong>Chief Architect</strong> at AVIV Group and previous works as a Principal Architect for eBay Classifieds and Adevinta.</p>

<p>Another vital part of my experience that shaped this book was my earlier experience as a <strong>consultant and analyst</strong> at the <a href="https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/">Software Improvement Group</a>, where I’ve learned the value and pragmatics of data-informed decision-making. As a spin-off of this work, I’ve also built a tool called <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>, which enables efficient and pragmatic extraction of data about technology and organization from source code. This work has directly influenced my view of <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a> part of the Grounded Architecture framework.</p>

<p>My experience as a <strong>CTO</strong> of <a href="https://incision.care">Incision</a>, a startup, has helped me better understand the challenges of creating and running an IT organization.</p>

<p>My experience as a <strong>researcher</strong> at <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/">Dutch Center for Computer Science and Mathematics (CWI)</a> and <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven Technical University (TU/e)</a> provided me with a valuable background to do rigorous data analyses and research. From this research period, I want to highlight a collection of essays, <a href="https://design-instability.com/">Design Instability</a>, that I co-authored with Erik Stolterman, where we connected experiences of designing/architecting in three disciplines: classical design, UX design, and software engineering. This work has helped me better relate to and learn from non-technical fields, a vital part of IT architects’ job.</p>

<p>Lastly, my hands-on experience as a <strong>software developer</strong> has proven invaluable for my work as an architect.</p>

<h2 id="the-structure-of-the-book">The Structure of the Book</h2>

<p>I have organized the book into several main parts. In the introductory part, I describe the context in which my ideas have developed.</p>

<p>In the second part, I discuss the Grounded Architecture framework and describe its three elements: Lightweight Architectural Analytics, Collaborative Networks, and the Operating Model.</p>

<p>In the third part, I discuss the Guiding Principles of Grounded Architecture, grouped into several sub-parts: On Being an Architect, On Soft Skills, On Decision-Making, On Human Complexity, and On Execution and Governance.</p>

<p>Finally, I conclude with a summary and encourage you to explore further with the help of the plentiful external resources I’ve provided.</p>

<p><br />
My work on creating and running an architecture practice isn’t just a lofty idea; it’s a <strong>practical approach</strong> sharpened from <strong>real-world experience.</strong> My perspective comes from lessons I learned as the Chief Architect at AVIV Group and the Principal Architect at eBay Classifieds and Adevinta.</p>

<p>To better grasp presented ideas or solutions, it is helpful to understand the problems we were trying to solve and <strong>the context</strong> in which these ideas were born. Here’s a peek into the context that shaped my Grounded Architecture approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global scale</strong>: the organizations I worked in were operating across multiple countries and continents with millions of users.</li>
  <li><strong>Multidimensional diversity</strong>: these organizations were diverse in terms of their customer base, workforce, business models, team topologies, and technology stacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Nonlinear growth dynamics</strong>: in addition to organic growth, complex organizations change their portfolio through mergers and acquisitions of new businesses or divestments.</li>
  <li><strong>Synergies and transformation pressures</strong>: complex organizations want to exploit the benefits of economies of scale and reduce duplication of efforts.</li>

<h2 id="global-scale">Global Scale</h2>

<p>I have honed my approach within genuinely global and multicultural organizations on a massive scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating across numerous <strong>geographies, cultures, and languages,</strong></li>
  <li>Serving <strong>millions of users</strong> daily,</li>
  <li>Collaborating with thousands of software <strong>developers</strong> across hundreds of product and development <strong>teams,</strong></li>
  <li>Implementing systems comprising hundreds of <strong>millions of lines of source code</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating on a global scale introduces several compelling opportunities for organizations. It can significantly increase organizational effectiveness by <strong>reducing duplication of effort</strong> through centralized shared activities. Additionally, leveraging <strong>economies of scale</strong> allows for cost advantages, such as lowering the unit prices of utilized technologies. Global operations also enhance <strong>business resilience and flexibility</strong>, enabling compensation for local market fluctuations with global resources. The expansive talent pool available to global organizations supports local and international initiatives. Moreover, these organizations possess significant resources to invest in supporting nonlinear growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As).</p>

<p>However, the global and massive scale also presents numerous challenges. It results in <strong>high organizational complexity</strong>, with thousands of potential communication channels within the organization. The <strong>complex technology landscape</strong> entails numerous interconnected services. Managing a large talent pool incurs <strong>high workforce costs</strong>. Furthermore, such organizations face high computing resource expenses due to the need to serve a vast customer base around the clock. The operational complexity increases with high and variable customer demands across multiple locations. Additionally, global organizations have a <strong>vast attack surface</strong>, with many potential entry points for attackers. Lastly, any manual process, such as creating an organizational or technology landscape overview, is limited due to the scale involved.</p>

<p>Balancing opportunities and challenges on a global scale has been one of the most demanding and rewarding aspects of my architectural work. Such a magnitude makes any manual process inefficient and difficult to scale. The global scale was one of the main drivers behind the aggressive datafication of our an architecture practice. It has also led us to create more decentralized collaborative networks and operating models to execute and track decision-making across the board.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="multi-dimensional-diversity">Multi-Dimensional Diversity</h2>

<p>The organizations I worked with were incredibly diverse across multiple dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cultures</strong>: A varied workforce and clientele, both local and remote.</li>
  <li><strong>Organization</strong>: Units of different sizes, complexities, and organizational styles.</li>
  <li><strong>Product</strong>: Diverse product features catering to various markets and customer segments.</li>
  <li><strong>IT Architecture</strong>: Combination of legacy systems and modern approaches.</li>
  <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Numerous programming languages and thousands of third-party libraries, frameworks, and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, I worked with organizational units differing in several aspects, including <strong>unit size,</strong> which ranged from hundreds of employees to just a dozen. The <strong>team topologies</strong> varied, spanning from single-team setups to hierarchical team organizations. Additionally, the <strong>architectural roles</strong> varied, with some units having dedicated local architecture teams and lead architects. In contrast, in smaller units, team members handled architectural duties alongside other responsibilities.</p>

<p>Similarly, technology-wise, we managed a range of styles in active production systems, from legacy <strong>monolithic</strong> applications to intricate modern <strong>microservice</strong> and <strong>serverless</strong> ecosystems. Each organizational segment had its own unique history and legacy systems. Our technology stack was extensive, covering multiple mainstream technologies. The infrastructure included several public cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and custom-built private data centers. Our systems employ various application technologies, including database technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, AWS RDS, and more. The backend programming languages used were Java, C#, Go, Scala, PHP, Node.js. We used Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Flutter/Dart, and more for mobile app programming. The frontend programming languages and frameworks included React, AngularJS, Vue, jQuery, and others.</p>

<p>Diversity offers several <strong>opportunities,</strong> including increased technology <strong>innovation.</strong> A diverse workforce can explore a variety of technologies and tools creatively. It also leads to better implementation because access to a broader <strong>pool of diverse resources</strong> allows for the selection of the best tool for the job.</p>

<p>However, diversity also brings challenges. One such challenge is <strong>increased complexity,</strong> resulting in a higher system landscape complexity and greater cognitive load for teams mastering numerous topics simultaneously. Additionally, there is <strong>reduced flexibility,</strong> as expertise spread across many domains and technologies limits reorganization possibilities. Furthermore, diversity can lead to higher <strong>technical debt</strong> due to multiple technology stacks, increasing legacy components, and outdated technologies. While diversity is a rich source of new possibilities from an architectural perspective, it always necessitates carefully managing complexity.</p>

<p>Diversity has influenced our an architecture practice in multiple ways. It has led to the development of lean tools that can cover a broad range of technology stacks rather than the adoption of specialized ones that can go deep on one stack but cannot cover 95% of our landscape. We also adopted a more flexible governance model to help all teams in a practical way that is aligned with their diverse ways of working.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="nonlinear-growth-dynamics">Nonlinear Growth Dynamics</h2>

<p>Complex organizations like the ones I have worked in are often highly dynamic. These organizations frequently undergo significant growth, contraction, and reorganization, evolving both <strong>organically</strong> and <strong>inorganically.</strong></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/blur-g6bc6ee2cc_1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p><strong>Organic growth</strong> refers to internal expansion driven by the company’s own operations. <strong>Inorganic change</strong> involves acquiring other businesses, opening new locations, or divesting parts of the company.</p>

<p>Nonlinear growth, in particular, can be advantageous in several scenarios. It can <strong>rapidly increase the customer base</strong> or introduce new market segments. Additionally, such changes can <strong>accelerate innovation</strong> by incorporating new technologies or services.</p>

<p>However, nonlinear growth dynamics significantly impact architectural activities. The sudden integration of new companies <strong>increases organizational complexity</strong>, introducing many new units. Acquiring a new company also <strong>brings in new technology and engineering units</strong>, along with their unique processes and technology stacks. Furthermore, these nonlinear dynamics <strong>necessitate a flexible architecture</strong> to accommodate potential divestitures.</p>

<p>Nonlinear growth offers substantial benefits but also challenges managing increased complexity and the need to maintain architectural flexibility. In terms of its impact on an architecture practice, such dynamics lead to constantly high levels of complexity and more uncertainty. This has led us to prioritize the creation of better transparency to track changes that such dynamics introduce. We also needed to collaborate closely with business and finance stakeholders on developing tools for economics and risk modeling of investments and divestments.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="synergy-and-transformation-pressures">Synergy and Transformation Pressures</h2>

<p>Complex organizations aim to grow not just in size, but also in efficiency by leveraging economies of scale, cost synergies, and enhancing their capacity for innovation. Our investors expect us to become <strong>more than the sum of our original parts</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/gears-g06fe4e9a5_1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Pursuing synergies and transformations offers several opportunities, such as <strong>cost reductions</strong> through less duplication and lower expenses. <strong>Accelerated innovation</strong> can occur as savings from cost reductions free up resources for new developments. Additionally, creating synergistic components enables more possibilities for <strong>reuse and sharing,</strong> while well-executed transformations result in increased <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>lower unit costs.</strong></p>

<p>However, striving for synergies and efficiency presents challenges. There is a need for significant <strong>initial investment</strong> to realize benefits, which carries high risks. Performance pressure arises as teams must deliver excellent <strong>short-term results</strong> while undergoing significant transformations. Balancing transformation activities with regular work can temporarily <strong>reduce productivity.</strong> Moreover, post-transformation, the organization and technology landscape may become more complex due to increased dependencies, such as reusing central services.</p>

<p>The pressure to achieve synergies and efficiency can lead to high expectations and complicate regular architectural work. Nonetheless, these forces also create numerous opportunities for growth and improvement. For an architecture practice, these pressures created a strong need for better tracking project costs, value, and risks. Being able to calculate and back with data decisions for both innovative projects and legacy retirements was a critical aspect of our work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="decentralization-and-loose-coupling">Decentralization and Loose Coupling</h2>

<p>Researcher Karl Weick developed the concepts of tight and loose coupling to describe organizational structures, initially in educational institutions and later applied to diverse businesses. According to Weick, a <strong>tightly coupled organization</strong> has mutually understood rules enforced by <em>inspection and feedback</em> systems. In such organizations, management can directly coordinate different departments’ activities according to a central strategy.</p>

<p>In contrast, a <strong>loosely coupled organization</strong> lacks some elements of a tightly coupled one. Employees have <strong>more autonomy</strong>, and different departments may operate with <strong>little coordination</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1321965054.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

<p>Most organizational units I worked with were loosely coupled. Our companies frequently grew through acquisitions of companies in different marketplaces. Business strategies also promoted the independent evolution of local units to address local market needs more effectively and quickly. These units often enjoyed a high level of autonomy, frequently with their development teams and sometimes with local CFOs, CMOs, or CEOs.</p>

<p>Loose coupling offers several advantages. It provides <strong>higher flexibility,</strong> allowing units to develop independently and address specific needs without synchronizing with other units. This flexibility leads to <strong>reduced time-to-market,</strong> as fewer dependencies enable marketplaces to rapidly change and evolve their products for local needs. Additionally, loose coupling <strong>fosters innovation</strong> by offering opportunities to quickly explore ideas in smaller contexts.</p>

<p>However, loose coupling also presents several challenges. It can lead to duplication of effort, as local market needs might differ but often have significant overlap in product features and technology, resulting in <strong>redundant efforts</strong> as each marketplace creates solutions for the same problems. This approach also increases <strong>accidental diversity,</strong> where limited synchronization may result in significantly different design and technology choices for the same problem, making it difficult to consolidate solutions, move personnel between teams, or benefit from economies of scale. Moreover, loose coupling results in <strong>limited control,</strong> as fewer dependencies and varying goals make it more challenging to implement changes across the organization.</p>

<p>From an architectural perspective, loose coupling presents an interesting challenge, often leading to a conflict between global alignment and control and local autonomy. For our an architecture practice, decentralization and loose coupling led to many changes. We emphasized “hands off, eyes on,” leaving teams autonomy in their work but creating complete transparency based on data. Our operating model has a high level of decentralization to enable both scaling and alignment of architecture work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Grounded Architecture emerged as a necessity in response to our <a href="context">intricate and multifaceted challenges</a>. The Grounded Architecture framework was designed to address these specific challenges. By moving away from manual processes and embracing automation, data-driven decision-making, and adaptive frameworks, we aimed to create a <strong>more resilient and effective</strong> an architecture practice.</p>

<p>In following sections I will outline a breakdown of the goals I set for an architecture practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Goal 1: Executing At Scale,</li>
  <li>Goal 2: Adaptivity,</li>
  <li>Goal 3: Increasing Quality of Decisions with Data,</li>
  <li>Goal 4: Maximizing Organizational Alignment,</li>
  <li>Goal 5: Maximizing Organizational Learning.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-1-executing-at-scale">Goal 1: Executing At Scale</h2>

<p>Our organizations were like a bustling city with hundreds of teams and thousands of projects, each with its own unique complexity and requirements. Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches to an architecture practice simply couldn’t keep up with this dynamic environment. We needed a system that could support this vast and varied ecosystem. Grounded Architecture was designed to <strong>handle such diversity at scale,</strong> ensuring that teams and projects received the tailored support they needed without being bogged down by rigid processes.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always having the <strong>full transparency</strong> about the technology landscape. Without full transparency, it isn’t easy to understand the landscape’s complexity or your work’s context. This transparency should include good data and visualization of the size and quality of all source code repositories, public cloud accounts and technologies, private data centers, development efforts, etc.</li>
  <li>Having mechanisms and spaces to maintain <strong>practical working relationships</strong> with all development teams and key stakeholders. Knowing the organizational landscape and having spaces for engagement is crucial.</li>
  <li>Being able to scale and grow the organization <strong>without</strong> introducing significant <strong>slowing of decision-making</strong>. Finding the right balance between teams’ autonomy and alignment is essential.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-2-adaptivity">Goal 2: Adaptivity</h2>

<p>In our dynamic environments, significant change is not just frequent; it’s expected. Whether these changes are organic, like evolving business needs, or inorganic, like mergers and acquisitions, our architecture must be <strong>able to adapt swiftly</strong>. Grounded Architecture was crafted to be flexible and responsive, allowing us to pivot quickly in response to new challenges and opportunities. This adaptability ensures that our architectural framework remains relevant and effective, no matter how the organizational landscape shifts.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Being able to track and support <strong>legacy and new technologies,</strong> adapting this support as the organization transforms, grows, acquires new legacy, and adopts new technologies.</li>
  <li>Having <strong>readily available data</strong> for analyses of different business scenarios (e.g., retire legacy vs. investment in legacy, buy-or-build, divestments).</li>
  <li>Being able to <strong>routinely onboard</strong> and quickly understand the technology landscape of acquired companies.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-3-increasing-quality-of-decisions-with-data">Goal 3: Increasing Quality of Decisions with Data</h2>

<p>Relying on gut feelings or individual opinions is always insufficient and risky when dealing with operations at scale. Decisions need to be based on solid data to <strong>ensure accuracy and reliability.</strong> Grounded Architecture aims to incorporate tools and mechanisms to support data-driven decision-making. By leveraging data and analytics, we can move away from subjective opinions and towards more objective, evidence-based decisions. This approach should enhance the quality of our decisions and facilitate their consistency and alignment with our organizational goals.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always having <strong>complete</strong>, <strong>up-to-date data</strong> about all key elements of the organizational technology landscape.</li>
  <li>Having technical data connected with <strong>product</strong> and <strong>business data</strong> (e.g., vibrancy vs. public cloud costs).</li>
  <li>Making data available via <strong>self-service tools</strong> for the organization so that more people can make data-informed decisions.</li>
  <li>Ensuring <strong>routine usage</strong> of the data in decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-4-maximizing-organizational-alignment">Goal 4: Maximizing Organizational Alignment</h2>

<p>In a global, fast-moving organization, misalignment can quickly become the norm. Different teams and departments might pursue conflicting objectives, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. Grounded Architecture aims to <strong>serve as a cohesive force,</strong> promoting alignment across the entire organization. Providing a clear, unified framework helps to minimize misalignments. It facilitates all parts of the organization working towards common goals. This alignment is crucial for maintaining efficiency and avoiding the chaos that can arise from disparate efforts.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Having pragmatic <strong>standardized guidelines</strong> and best practices (e.g., golden paths) for technology use, ensuring consistency across the organization.</li>
  <li>Fostering a <strong>culture of collaboration</strong> and knowledge sharing among teams to align on technology choices and implementation strategies.</li>
  <li>Regularly <strong>reviewing and updating</strong> technology standards to align with evolving business needs and industry trends.</li>
  <li>Identifying and eliminating <strong>redundant processes</strong> and activities to streamline operations and reduce wasted resources.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="goal-5-maximizing-organizational-learning">Goal 5: Maximizing Organizational Learning</h2>

<p>Staying current with emerging technologies and industry trends is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. Still, it can be challenging when dealing with the demands of legacy systems. Grounded Architecture should facilitate continuous learning and growth. It supports the rapid adoption of new technologies and encourages <strong>ongoing education and training.</strong> Grounded Architecture should ensure we always have the best tools and knowledge to drive innovation and improvement.</p>

<p>Some of the success criteria for this goal included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organizing frequent workshops, seminars, and training sessions to facilitate <strong>sharing knowledge</strong> and best practices across the organization.</li>
  <li>Encouraging employees at all levels to contribute to and participate in knowledge-sharing initiatives, promoting a <strong>culture of continuous learning.</strong></li>
  <li>Developing platforms and tools that enable <strong>easy access</strong> to shared knowledge and resources, enhancing collective expertise.</li>
  <li>Involving <strong>diverse stakeholders,</strong> including developers, managers, and end-users, in discussions and decision-making processes related to architecture and technology.</li>
  <li><strong>Creating opportunities</strong> for employees from various departments to engage in architectural planning and feedback sessions to learn from each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>These criteria aim to create an inclusive and dynamic environment where knowledge is freely shared, and diverse contributions are not just welcomed, but valued.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<p>Knowing what goals an architecture practice needs to support in your organization is crucial to defining structures and measuring your impact. Some of the plans may be universally applicable. Others may be unique to your context. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What is the scale of your an architecture practice? Does your scale require special measures to ensure your an architecture practice efficient operations?</em></li>
  <li><em>What are the key decisions you need to make? Do you have the data to base your decisions?</em></li>
  <li><em>How aligned are units in your organizations? How much friction is there? How can an architecture practice help?</em></li>
  <li><em>How much is your organization learning? How is the learning supported?</em></li>
  <li><em>How stable is your organization? How likely is it that significant changes will occur in your organization?</em></li>

<p><br />
In this part, I will briefly introduce the Grounded Architecture framework. I chose the term “Grounded Architecture” to highlight that the primary goal of my approach is <strong>avoid having an “ivory tower” an architecture practice</strong> disconnected from the organization. This disconnection is a real danger in a <a href="context">fast-moving, global, and diverse setting</a>.</p>

<p>The Grounded Architecture framework is designed to be a <strong>practical solution.</strong> It aims to be <strong>deeply rooted</strong> in the organization, prioritizing <strong>people’s interactions</strong> and <strong>data</strong> over processes and tools. The goal is to connect an architecture practice to all parts and levels of the organization, serving as a practical antidote to the ‘ivory tower’ architecture. In this part of the ebook, I will delve into the framework’s structure and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Grounded Architecture framework is an approach to setting organizational structures for an architecture practice, and it has three elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight Architectural Analytics,</li>
  <li>Collaborative Networks,</li>
  <li>The Operating Model.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework.</em></p>

<p><em>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</em> is <strong>a system of tools and resources</strong> that enables architects to make <strong>data-informed decisions</strong> based on a real-time and complete overview of the organization’s technology landscape. <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics section</a> provides more details.</p>

<p><em>Collaborative Networks</em> <strong>connect all the people</strong> doing architecture across the organization. Thse networks are crucial to ensure that an architecture practice has any <strong>tangible impact</strong>. The <a href="people">Collaborative Networks section</a> provides more details.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <em>Operating Model</em> defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="operating-model">General Principles</a></strong>: I’ve defined several <strong>general guidelines</strong> on directing architects to do everything an architecture practice typically does, leveraging Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="six-simple-rules">Cooperation-Based Operating Model: Six Simple Rules</a></strong>: Grounded Architecture is particularly well-suited for organizations organized based on cooperation. As businesses grow increasingly complex, the importance of cooperation within organizational structures cannot be overstated. The “Six Simple Rules” framework emphasizes that successful organizations leverage their members’ collective judgment and cooperation. By fostering a culture of collaboration, organizations can better utilize their capabilities to address and resolve complex problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="governance">IT Governance: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates</a></strong>: Governance in technology is a critical aspect of any operating model. I propose a governance model incorporating three styles: nudging, taxation, and mandates. Nudging involves subtle policy shifts that guide behavior without restricting choices, while taxation uses economic incentives to encourage desired outcomes. Mandates and bans provide direct regulations to ensure compliance and standardization. This multifaceted approach allows for flexible and effective governance, balancing innovation with control and ensuring technological initiatives align with broader organizational goals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While I elaborately discuss many faces of the operating model, I want to emphasize that any Operating Model is only relevant if there are <strong>healthy Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks</strong>. Without data and people connections, an operating model leads to an ivory tower institution, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.</p>

Everywhere I worked on creating an architecture practice, I strongly (aka obsessively) <strong>emphasized data.</strong> Consequently, one of the first steps I make in any an architecture practice is to create an Lightweight Architectural Analytics to get a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of an organization’s technology landscapes (Figure 1). Manual documentation does not scale, and relying on data ensures the reliability and scalability of decision-making.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-data.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework: Lightweight Architectural Analytics.</em></p>

<p><br />
The good news is that <strong>big organizations have lots of data</strong> that, if used wisely, can provide an excellent basis for an architectural Lightweight Architectural Analytics. With some <strong>automation</strong> and lots of <strong>curation</strong>, getting a crystal clear overview of the technology landscape may be closer than it initially appears.</p>

<p>I call the tools I will discuss in this section <strong>lightweight</strong> to emphasize that, you don’t need to begin with costly or overly complicated software platforms. Plenty of simple and affordable tools—many of them open-source—can help you gain meaningful insights without breaking the bank.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="examples-of-lightweight-architectural-analytics-tools">Examples of Lightweight Architectural Analytics Tools</h2>

<p>To illustrate what I mean by Lightweight Architectural Analytics, I will give a few concrete examples from my recent work (Figure 2).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/apps.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" />
<br />
<strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>A screenshot of the start page of the architecture data dashboard we’ve built and used at AVIV Group.</em></p>

<p>I typically implement Lightweight Architectural Analytics as a dashboard with many data apps, typically leveraging the following data sources (Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Source code</strong> contains an incredible amount of information about technology, people’s activity, team dependencies, and the quality of software systems. By analyzing commit histories, code complexity, and contributions, you can identify critical areas of improvement, understand team dynamics, and ensure code quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Public cloud billing reports</strong> provide an overview of trends in used cloud services, regions, and budgets. Monitoring billing reports can help manage budgets, identify cost-saving opportunities, and understand usage patterns across different services and regions.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident reports</strong> can reveal trends and dependencies among incidents. Analyzing these reports can reveal trends, common issues, and dependencies among incidents, helping manage problems and improving system reliability.</li>
  <li><strong>Key business metrics</strong>, like vibrancy, can show user activity on our systems. Tracking these metrics can help assess the business’s health, understand user behavior, and guide strategic decisions to enhance user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Activity reports from messaging and collaboration platforms (such as Slack)</strong> can help understand discussion topics and team interactions. Analyzing these reports can help understand collaboration patterns, identify key discussion areas, and improve team communication and productivity.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/figures/architecture-dashboard-data-sources.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" />
<strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>A overview of data sources for the architecture dahsboard in the AVIV Group.</em></p>

<p>In the following sections, I detail several of these architectural data-driven tools.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-1-source-code-and-commit-history-analytics">Example 1: Source Code and Commit History Analytics</h3>

<p>The <strong>source code</strong> and its <strong>commit history</strong> are like a treasure chest for creating data-driven architecture documentation—packed with nuggets of wisdom about <strong>technology</strong>, team <strong>activities,</strong> <strong>dependencies,</strong> and software quality.</p>

<p>Many tools can help you reveal these insights. In this section, I will focus on a simple tool I built to get these insights. To help you dig up this treasure without getting your hands too dirty, I’ve developed and actively maintained a free, open-source project called <strong><a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>.</strong> Sokrates generates reports with essential source code insights (see Figure 4). Its reports are designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for a broader audience to navigate and understand their source code and its history. Sokrates is designed with an <strong>architect’s x-ray vision,</strong> allowing you to <strong>zoom in and out</strong> of source code landscapes. It provides a <strong>high-level overview</strong> of the IT landscape, summarizing data from various teams and groups while also letting you dive deep into the <strong>code-level details.</strong> This dual functionality makes it the perfect sidekick for <strong>CTO-level</strong> strategy powwows and <strong>developer-level</strong> code critiques.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/sokrates-example-1.png" style="padding: 4px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 1px 4px; margin-bottom: 6px" />
<br />
<strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Screenshot of a Sokrates report.</em></p>

<p>Show me, don’t tell me, you said? All right, for a more entertaining look at what Sokrates can do, check out the Sokrates examples. Here are some blockbusters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://d3axxy9bcycpv7.cloudfront.net/asf/_sokrates_landscape/index.html">Apache Software Foundation Repositories</a></strong>: An epic saga of over 1,000 repositories with more than 180 million lines of code, 22,000 contributors, and 2.4 million commits.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to standard source code and commit history analyses, I also have built several special source code analyses to get further details:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Travis and Jenkins Analyzers</strong>: Perfect for sleuthing how teams build CI/CD pipelines.</li>
  <li><strong>Dockerfile Scan</strong>: Creates a tech radar of runtime technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub API Pull Request Analyses</strong>: To identify deployment frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to use these or similar tools, but I encourage you to experiment with your source-code analyses as well.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-2-public-cloud-usage-analytics">Example 2: Public Cloud Usage Analytics</h3>

<p>Thanks to <strong>uniform automation and monitoring,</strong> using the public cloud can dramatically increase transparency. The public cloud transparency offers incredibly valuable data out-of-the-box.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a>, and other public cloud providers give detailed data about which platform uses which services, resource family, and budget. You can also understand which people and teams have access to each service. Getting real-time information about cloud usage and automatically understanding the trends is straightforward.</p>

<p>Figure 5 shows an anonymized screenshot of the Cloud Usage Explorer, a tool I built to visualize automatically collected data from standard Google Cloud Platform (GCP) usage reports.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/archdata/cloud-usage-explorer.png" alt="" />
<br />
<em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> An example of a cloud usage explorer.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-3-financial-and-vibrancy-analytics">Example 3: Financial and Vibrancy Analytics</h3>

<p><strong>Finance departments</strong> are like Sherlock Holmes in the business world—super data-driven and always on the case with high-quality data that could be a goldmine for architects. Beyond the usual suspects of costs, budgets, and other dry financial stuff, I’ve discovered they also track the fun stuff, like vibrancy and usage levels. This data is not just interesting; it’s invaluable for architects’ work.</p>

<p>These finance operatives need this juicy data to, for instance, link the performance of their financial systems with how much they’re being used. This kind of usage data is a secret weapon for architecture discussions. For instance, by connecting systems’ usage levels and vibrancy with their public cloud costs, we can uncover hidden areas of improvement and inefficiencies (Figure 6).</p>

<p>So, next time you’re knee-deep in architectural plans, don’t forget to call the finance for top-notch data insights!</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/cross-data.png" alt="" />
<br />
<em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Combining data from different sources (e.g., cloud billing reports and vibrancy or revenue can lead to new insights (e.g., identifying inefficiencies in the application portfolio).</em></p>

<p>Nice — that’s a great addition and feels totally aligned with the whole <strong>“data as a map”</strong> metaphor from the main text. You’re basically saying: <em>once you have that map, you can start asking your digital guide (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) for directions, insights, or even a little code to fix potholes.</em></p>

<p>Here’s a draft for your new subsection under <strong>“Examples of Lightweight Architectural Analytics Tools”</strong>:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="example-4-leveraging-generative-ai">Example 4: Leveraging Generative AI</h3>

<p>Once you’ve built a solid foundation of <strong>curated, up-to-date, and accessible data</strong>, a whole new layer of value becomes available through <strong>generative AI tools</strong> such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or open-source LLMs. These tools can act as intelligent companions for architectural work, transforming your data into <strong>interactive conversations</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of static dashboards or one-off reports, you can now ask natural-language questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“What teams are committing most to legacy systems?”</li>
  <li>“Which services have the highest cost-to-vibrancy ratio?”</li>
  <li>“Can you cluster microservices based on team ownership and code activity?”</li>
  <li>“What are some anomalies in our incident frequency over the past 90 days?”</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach works <em>only</em> when data is already available, curated, and reasonably structured. That’s why <strong>Lightweight Architectural Analytics</strong> is such a critical enabler—it ensures that the <strong>fuel for AI analysis</strong> is already there.</p>

<p>Some practical applications of this integration include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Additional Source Code Insights</strong>: Upload commit logs or Sokrates reports and prompt AI with questions about team dynamics, code complexity, or deployment patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exploring Cloud Usage and Cost Optimization</strong>: Share public cloud billing exports and ask the AI to identify trends, inefficiencies, or underutilized services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Incident Pattern Analysis</strong>: Feed in incident ticket logs and ask for root cause patterns, recurring services, or teams with frequent incident ownership.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Business Metrics Exploration</strong>: Ask the AI to find correlations between system vibrancy and cloud costs, or between system uptime and team size.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Communication Trends</strong>: Analyze Slack activity logs to find dominant discussion themes or cross-team communication patterns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="gen-ai-prompts">the appendix</a>, you’ll find <strong>example prompts</strong> and <strong>sample curated datasets</strong> you can upload or use as inspiration to get started.</p>

<p>Generative AI doesn’t replace the need for good architectural judgment—but it <strong>amplifies it</strong>, by giving you fast feedback, exploratory analysis, and sometimes even fresh angles you might not have considered.</p>

<p>Interestingly, prompts themselves are more than just one-time queries—they can evolve into a <strong>formal, reusable description of typical architectural tasks</strong>. By writing and refining prompts, architects essentially codify their thought process and decision-making patterns.</p>

<p>Prompts become:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight, transparent documentation of analysis goals</li>
  <li>A repeatable way to “ask the same question” of new data</li>
  <li>A way to share architectural thinking across teams and roles</li>
  <li>A medium to teach junior team members how to approach common problems</li>
</ul>

<p>You can think of prompts as <em>scripts for architectural sensemaking.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-a-lightweight-architectural-analytics">Requirements For A Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h2>

<p>Lightweight Architectural Analytics should be a central place with <strong>authoritative, relevant, and curated data</strong> about the organizational technology landscape. Technically, you can implement Lightweight Architectural Analytics tools like those discussed in the previous section, using simple resources like Google Drive, with documents organized in folders or as an internal website. I recommend investing some effort in creating better infrastructure and user experience, as it can enable more people to access and benefit from data. A solid setup will make it easier for more people to access and benefit from the data, turning it into a real asset rather than a digital junk drawer.</p>

<p>Simply collecting and putting data in one place will not create any value. Regardless of how you implement your Lightweight Architectural Analytics, with papers on the wall, in Google Drive, in Confluence, or with a nicely designed internal website, I have identified the following requirements that Lightweight Architectural Analytics needs to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It is the single point of truth</strong> for all relevant architectural data. People should be able to go to one place and get relevant data.</li>
  <li><strong>It is curated for quality</strong> so people can trust the data. Simply dumping data into one place will not help. You need to own curation to ensure that data are correct. You also should provide links to data sources so people can verify the facts.</li>
  <li><strong>It is curated for usability</strong> so people stay focused on valuable details. You must filter out useless or less relevant details, focusing on the essence. Investing in the UX design of documents or tools you create helps.</li>
  <li><strong>It is kept up to date</strong>, ideally in an automated fashion (or semi-automated, repeatable way).</li>
  <li><strong>It is accessible to the whole organization</strong>. I genuinely believe that when you give employees access to information generally reserved for specialists, architects, or “higher levels,” they get more done independently. They can work faster without stopping to ask for information and approval. And they make better decisions without needing input from architects or the top.</li>
  <li><strong>It is used in decision-making</strong>. Having nicely curated and valuable data has zero value if you cannot ensure that such data informs vital decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>It is built like a map.</strong> Maps are some of the most crucial documents in human history—they help us store and exchange knowledge about space and place. One thing all maps do is provide readers with a <strong>sense of orientation.</strong> And that, in a nutshell, is what Lightweight Architectural Analytics should offer people in your organization: a sense of orientation in a waste space of technology, organizational, and business topics. The map metaphor is also helpful, as maps come with <strong>multiple layers.</strong> Similarly, the architecture of Lightweight Architectural Analytics should give readers data layers about systems that describe their sizes, connections, quality, security, or human activity. It’s like having a trusty map that shows you where the treasure is and warns you about the dragons.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="building-lightweight-architectural-analytics">Building Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h2>

<p>While each organization has its own quirky set of data, here are some tips I’ve found helpful in forming the Lightweight Architectural Analytics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Start with the source code.</strong> My motto is <strong><em>“Talk is expensive. Show me the code.”</em></strong> Because let’s face it, code never lies—people, on the other hand, might forget a detail or two. I scan source code as soon as possible using tools like <a href="https://sokrates.dev">Sokrates</a>. Modern IT enterprises store almost everything as code. It’s the richest and most up-to-date documentation on what’s happening. Quick source code scans can reveal that your “simple” system is actually a digital spaghetti monster.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect with finance and governance teams.</strong> My second motto is <strong><em>“Follow the money!”</em></strong> You’d be amazed at what you can learn from finance data (minus the sensitive parts, like revenue projections—let’s keep those secrets safe). Cloud billing reports and tech usage trends are collected anyway. Extract and connect these to get new insights without pestering people for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain a culture of transparency.</strong> A culture of transparency means having an organizational environment where open communication, honest information sharing, and accountability are actively encouraged and practiced at all levels. Such a culture allows simplicity, as you need less complex authorization mechanisms.</li>
  <li><strong>Own the curation.</strong> People need to trust your data like they trust their morning coffee to wake them up. Spend time understanding data sets, curate them, and ensure they’re consistently presented. Think of yourself as the master curator and chief UX designer of Lightweight Architectural Analytics.</li>
  <li><strong>Use simple and easy-to-maintain infrastructures.</strong> For example, I publish the results of Sokrates analyses and other data tools as static resources on our enterprise GitHub pages. Avoid the headache of complex databases and backend software. In the <a href="https://github.com/zeljkoobrenovic/grounded-architecture-dashboard-examples">Architecture Dashboard Examples repository</a>, you’ll find the source code for building the Architecture Data Dashboard. The dashboard is a simple static website generated from JSON files and <a href="https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/grounded-architecture-dashboard-examples/">published via GitHub pages</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These tips might save you from drowning in the sea of data chaos and make your architectural life a bit smoother—or at least give you a few laughs.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="using-lightweight-architectural-analytics">Using Lightweight Architectural Analytics</h2>

<p>Lightweight Architectural Analytics can churn out data by the bucketful. Think of it like an atlas or a map—it’s great for finding your bearings and understanding the lay of the land. But, with the <strong>right mindset,</strong> you can turn that data into a treasure trove of insights.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-2166193783.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Interpreting and using data requires a bit of effort—think of it as a <strong>detective game</strong> where the data holds the answers, but you need to come armed with the right questions. Here are some of the questions you should ask when you’ve got a pile of data at your fingertips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Are we all rowing in the same direction?</strong> Source code overviews, public cloud usage explorers, or tech radars can highlight when systems and teams are out of sync, sparking heated debates that lead to real action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Are we making the most of our technology?</strong> Comparing usage trends between teams can reveal fascinating outliers—both the virtuosos and those who are… let’s say, still tuning their guitars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Are there signs our systems might need a little TLC (tender, loving care)?</strong> Look out for oversized systems, rampant duplication, and files that go on longer than your Aunt Marge’s vacation slideshows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Productivity trends: is more really more, or is more actually less?</strong> For instance, comparing the number of git merges to the number of developers can reveal if our dev processes are scalable. When scaling up teams, we aim to speed up delivery, but without proper structure, we might end up with a digital mosh pit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Are we collaborating the way we want to?</strong> Repository analysis can reveal team topologies and unwanted dependencies. Sometimes, teams collaborate like a well-oiled machine; other times, it’s more like a group project in high school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Are we working on what we really want to?</strong> We may aspire to innovate, but if we’re spending most of our time wrestling with legacy maintenance, we might need to rethink our priorities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So there you have it. The data’s ready to spill its secrets—you need to know the right questions to ask. So, what is your question?</p>

Good architects are a rare breed. They bridge the gaps between business, product, organizational, and technology issues. They’re like the Swiss Army knives of the tech world. Hiring architects is like searching for a unicorn who’s also a full-stack developer with a knack for diplomacy. They need not only in-depth technical knowledge but also domain-specific and organizational knowledge.</p>

<p>So, you cannot just 3D print your architects or hire them in buckets. But you can carefully organize, empower, and leverage this scarce talent (Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-people.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework: Collaborative Networks.</em></p>

<p>A strong network of people doing architecture is crucial for any real impact. In simpler terms, <strong>Strong Architecture = Strong Architects</strong>.</p>

<p>In my recent escapades, I worked with two teams of architect teams: a small <strong>central architecture team</strong> and <strong>a cross-organizational distributed virtual team</strong>. The central team is like the wise elders, guiding and supporting the rest of the organization. The distributed virtual team, on the other hand, is a merry band of rebels, working locally but also connecting across the organization, increasing transparency, building networks, and implementing change. Together, such a mix of central and distributed teams can create a robust <strong>collaborative network</strong> driving change across an organization.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="background-central-vs-federated-architecture-practice">Background: Central vs. Federated Architecture Practice</h2>

<p>An IT architecture practice generally follow one of two fundamental models: central or federated (Figure 2, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/crafting-the-optimal-model-for-the-it-architecture-organization">McKinsey 2022</a>).</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/arch_teams.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Central vs. Federated Architecture Practice.</em></p>

<p><strong>The central model</strong> is like a tightly run coffee shop. A large central team sets the rules, approves new work, and ensures everyone follows the script. Development teams in this model are like customers with no coffee-making skills, relying entirely on the central baristas. The central team handles infrastructure, operations, and security—essentially controlling the caffeine supply chain.</p>

<p><strong>The federated model</strong> is more like a coffee co-op, where each team has its own barista. A small central team or an <strong>architecture center of excellence (CoE)</strong> might provide high-level guidance, but the real magic happens locally. These baristas (architects) are embedded in development teams, facilitating high-level planning and acting as on-demand service providers.</p>

<p>The <strong>federated model</strong> is a favorite among <strong>cross-functional DevOps cultures</strong>. It integrates infrastructure, operations, and security into its brews. Architects in this model focus on <strong>facilitation and enablement</strong>, and stay close to the action.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="the-hybrid-model">The Hybrid Model</h2>

<p>To operate in a complex context, you must invest effort to ensure you have the <strong>right people at the right places</strong>. In the end, I usually found it best to adopt a model of a hybrid organization combining elements of central and federated orientation structures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Small Central Architectural Team, and</li>
  <li>Architecture Guilds &amp; Virtual Architectural Teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>This model is similar to the previously described <strong>federated model</strong> but with extra investment in a central team that should be more than just an on-demand service provider.</p>

<p>Think of it as a symphony orchestra, where the central team is the conductor, and the guilds and virtual teams are the talented musicians playing different instruments. Sure, each musician can play their part solo, but without the conductor, it might sound more like a chaotic jam session at your neighbor’s garage.</p>

<p>I prefer the <strong>hybrid team structure</strong> as it scales better in complex organizations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Guilds</strong> and virtual architecture teams support execution by <strong>increasing the number of people involved</strong> in architectural activities and increasing work efficiency through better alignment. Members representing various organizational units can have much <strong>more impact across the board</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having some <strong>capacity on the central level</strong> serves as a <strong>catalyst,</strong> helping people at local levels to do their jobs while being aligned and better connected with overall strategic goals and other teams working on related topics.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="central-architecture-team">Central Architecture Team</h3>

<p>The roles of people in central teams may differ depending on the organization. However, it’s crucial to recognize uniwue value a central architecture team.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-480342200.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Such a team, in addition to the doing architecture work, can be instrumental in covering these often overlooked responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build and maintain the architecture <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a>.</strong> With all AI advances, it will not build itself! You need clear ownership, curation, and technical support to make it work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Promote data-informed decision-making.</strong> It’s not enough to have data; you’ve got to <em>use</em> it. This is like trying to convince your grandpa to use a smartphone—challenging but doable. Architects should be tech-savvy wizards who show everyone else how things are done, making data the critical actor of every decision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proactively identify, connect, and maintain relationships with all relevant stakeholders.</strong> Think of architects as the social butterflies at a high school reunion—they’ve got to bridge all the cliques. Connecting different organizational units and stakeholders is their superpower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build internal architecture communities and guilds.</strong> Organizing rituals and gatherings takes effort.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While guilds and virtual teams can handle many of these activities, their voluntary and sometimes laid-back nature makes their support less reliable. The central architecture team can step in like the dependable backup generator, taking full long-term ownership and ensuring continuity, even if the community vibe fizzles out.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="architecture-guilds--virtual-architecture-teams">Architecture Guilds &amp; Virtual Architecture Teams</h3>

<p>I’ve always found it crucial to rally passionate troops about architecture through a guild, a community of interest, or a virtual team. After all, who doesn’t love a good architecture geek meet-up?</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1199706305.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Our guilds or virtual team members typically double as architects or tech leads in their respective departments. But they also moonlight by collaborating with their counterparts from other areas. These <strong>peer-to-peer communities</strong> are collectively responsible for spotting and nurturing architectural talent, mentoring, and helping each other out of sticky situations.</p>

<p>If you end up having an overabundance of guilds and teams, you can try splitting them into different cliques:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>General or core teams</strong>: These folks could tackle various general architectural topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialist teams</strong>: These teams can focus on specific parts of the tech stack, such as native mobile apps, web frontends, or public clouds.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic initiatives teams</strong>: These teams work on the big picture, such as data strategy, public cloud strategy, transactions, or verticalization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Connecting the central and distributed teams is essential. In most places I’ve worked, we organized gatherings to facilitate regular alignments, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regular (e.g., bi-weekly) forums</strong>: Here, updates are shared, architectural spikes are announced, and decisions are debated.</li>
  <li><strong>Annual or bi-annual summits</strong>: These are the architecture equivalent of Comic-Con, with several days of intense knowledge sharing and workshops.</li>
  <li><strong>Ad-hoc workshops</strong>: These focus on specific topics and deep dives into niche subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the central team can provide essential support, all communities must take the initiative and get many people involved in these events. It’s crucial that people are <strong>active participants</strong> rather than passive spectators to ensure more engagement and commitment. So, get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive in, because architecture is a team sport, and everyone needs to play their part!</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="building-collaborative-networks">Building Collaborative Networks</h2>

<p>While each organization will need its unique approach, here are some tips I found helpful when forming architecture teams and building Collaborative Networks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before making grandiose plans for reorganizations, <strong>connect with the people already doing architectural work</strong> in an organization. Bring together all the critical tech leaders, regardless of their position and title. Being well-connected to these folks will be crucial in any architecture organization, so this effort is never wasted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If creating a virtual team is a part of your architecture strategy, move away from the informal community of practice and start <strong>building a team with more accountability and responsibility</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connect with non-architecture people</strong> early to gain broader support for building architecture teams and guilds. Being well-connected to these stakeholders is crucial to have strong collaborative networks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoid hiring <a href="https://architectelevator.com/transformation/dont-hire-hitman/">a digital hitman</a></strong>. Instead, invest in growing internal talent. Think of it this way: architects need to know the technology, the domain, and the organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Externalize</strong>. Reach out and connect. Participate in external events. Publish your work. Being strong externally can help you grow and attract architectural talent. Everyone wants to join the band when you’re rocking the stage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions-to-consider">Questions to Consider</h2>

<p>It is difficult to overestimate the importance of people for an architecture practice, yet many organizations take architectural talent for granted. To reflect on the importance of carefully organizing, empowering, and leveraging scarce architecture talent, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Do you have a strong network of architects across the organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>Which central, federated, or hybrid model best represents your current an architecture practice? Why was this model chosen, and how effective has it been for your organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>If you are part of a central architecture team, how would you support the rest of the organization? How would you contribute to the global an architecture practice if you were part of a distributed virtual team?</em></li>
  <li><em>Consider having the roles of central architecture teams and federated architecture teams in your organization. How would they complement each other?</em></li>
  <li><em>How effective is the current division of responsibilities among architects in your organization? Are there areas of overlap or gaps in coverage?</em></li>
  <li><em>What steps has your organization taken to ensure architects are well-connected across all parts and levels? What impact has this had on transparency and the implementation of changes?</em></li>
  <li><em>Reflect on the diversity of team structures within your organization. How does this diversity impact the roles and responsibilities of architects?</em></li>

<p><br />
Each organization will have different architectural needs and contexts. When forming an architecture practice, I use as a starting point these <a href="https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/">two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Your architecture team’s job is to <strong>solve your biggest problems</strong>. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that.”</em></li>
  <li><em>“Your organization has to earn its way to an effective an architecture practice. <strong>You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess</strong> and expect it to solve all your problems.”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Considering Gregor Hohpe’s previous two points, I approach defining an architecture practice with the mindset that there is no one-size-fits-all method. You must find your own activities and operating models to enable architecture to solve the most critical problems.</p>

<div class="quote">
There is no one-size-fits-all approach: each organization must find activities and operating models that enable architecture to solve the most critical problems.
</div>

<p>No matter which operating models you select, it’s crucial to develop <strong>explicit agreements</strong> and “rules of engagement” with key stakeholders. This collaborative approach is essential to create a sustainable and practical an architecture practice.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/model-operating-model.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Grounded Architecture framework: Operating Model.</em></p>

<p>This section outlines some lessons I learned when defining IT architecture operating models. The Operating Model (Figure 1) is a part of the Grounded Architecture framework that defines a set of <strong>processes and agreements</strong> that allow architects to do everything an architecture practice typically does. The model should leverage Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to develop a data-informed, organization-wide impact. Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks provide a basis for data-informed decision-making that is well-embedded in the organization.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="examples-of-architecture-activities">Examples of Architecture Activities</h2>

<p>An Operating Model enables a structured and strategic approach to an architecture practice within the organization.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-479875962.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/StockPlanets">BraunS</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

<p>Here are examples of the activities I have been engaged in with architects to provide a clearer understanding of what I mean by an operating model.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Designing Mechanisms for Teams to Make Better Decisions</strong>: These mechanisms involved creating global decision-support frameworks such as advisory forums facilitating informed discussions across teams. For compliance-sensitive projects, we establish formal design authorities. Additionally, we develop team-specific mechanisms, like escalation paths, to resolve decision conflicts effectively (e.g., when teams disagree on a common messaging middleware).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Teams in Their Daily Work</strong>: This support entailed integrating into key team activities and aligning architectural work with team rituals to provide timely support. We assisted teams during all critical phases, such as reviewing architecture proposals before the commencement of a project or sprint, ensuring alignment with overall architectural standards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Planned New Initiatives and Projects</strong>: Ensuring seamless alignment between projects that require multi-team collaboration is crucial. We worked to facilitate communication and coordination, ensuring all teams are on the same page regarding project goals and requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Teams in Dealing with the Legacy Landscape</strong>: We provided data and insights about the legacy landscape, identifying problematic areas such as frequently changed, low-quality, untested legacy code. We helped define scenarios and roadmaps for legacy modernization, ensuring a structured approach to updating and maintaining legacy systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tracking Tech Debt and Defining Tech Debt Reduction Programs</strong>: This involves creating a centrally aligned backlog of technical debt and defining programs for its reduction. We integrate these programs into the planning processes to ensure that tech debt is managed proactively and effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Performing SWOT and Other Analyses of Platforms and Systems</strong>: Conducting deep dives to understand specific areas of the technology landscape. We performed SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analyses and other assessments. These analyses helped in creating comprehensive plans and roadmaps for improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Standardizing Processes and Documentation</strong>: We defined standard templates for key documents such as Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), Technical Design Reviews (TDRs), and common diagrams. This standardization ensures consistency and clarity across all architectural documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supporting Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A) Activities with Expertise and Analyses</strong>: We provided analyses, recommendations, and integration planning for mergers and acquisitions. Such support ensures that architectural considerations are well-integrated into M&amp;A activities, facilitating smoother transitions and integrations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defining Key Technology Strategies</strong>: We contributed to the development of essential technology strategies, including those for Cloud, Data, and Platforms. These strategies provide a clear roadmap for technological development and investment, ensuring alignment with business goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defining Vision and Direction of Technology</strong>: In collaboration with Engineering Leaders, we created a sustainable organizational setting that aligns with the overarching technology strategies. This work involved setting a clear vision and direction for the technology landscape within the organization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="guiding-principles-for-architectural-excellence-policies-autonomy-and-engagement">Guiding Principles for Architectural Excellence: Policies, Autonomy, and Engagement</h2>

<p>In this section, I address different guiding principles of architectural work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our <strong>operating framework</strong> always emphasizes a <strong>collaborative</strong> and <strong>supportive</strong> approach. Architects should empower development teams to make most decisions while ensuring strategic alignment and minimal compatibility. Architects should engage early in processes to <strong>avoid bureaucratic delays,</strong> focus on constant motion between daily support and strategic tasks, and use data to inform decisions.</li>
  <li>The <strong>distributed decision-making</strong> model promotes team autonomy complemented by high transparency and alignment, guided by principles that balance autonomy with global consistency.</li>
  <li>The “Golden Paths” concept enhances uniformity and efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="high-level-operating-framework">High-Level Operating Framework</h3>

<p>While exact activities and their scope will depend on an organization setting and will change over time, I usually followed a common operational framework in daily work inspired by Gregor Hohpe’s strategy-principles-decisions model (Figure 2).</p>

<div>
<a href="assets/images/arch/architecture-system.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="assets/images/arch/architecture-system.png" />
</a>
</div>
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>A common operating framework I typically use for Grounded Architecture activities.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Here are the key characteristics of this operating framework:</p>

<p><strong>Engagement mindset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architects engage with stakeholders and teams in a <strong>collaborative and supportive manner</strong>.</li>
  <li>Architects aim to <strong>empower the teams</strong> so that they make most of the decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contributions of architects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bring relevant data</strong> to inform decisions leveraging <a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Define decision boundaries</strong> to enable minimal compatibility and strategic alignment (e.g., golden paths or tech stack constraints).</li>
  <li><strong>Define fundamental principles</strong> to facilitate consistency in decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Share and generalize</strong> lessons learned via <a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social dynamics of architects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architects spend their time in <strong>constant motion</strong> between supporting teams’ <strong>daily work</strong> and working on <strong>strategic topics</strong>, helping the organization achieve alignment between strategy and implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shift left</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid <strong>formal bureaucratic approval</strong> processes, where architects appear too late and are frequently busy approving trivial decisions.</li>
  <li>Have architects <strong>involved early</strong> in any of the processes, such as during the planning and preparation stages, where it is possible to make more significant changes. Think of it as having the architects as early birds catching the architectural worms, making big changes before the day officially starts.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="distributing-decisions-autonomy-and-alignment">Distributing Decisions, Autonomy, and Alignment</h3>

<p>With any operating model, I aim to keep architectural decision-making distributed across the organization and embedded in the development teams. Development <strong>teams traditionally have the best insights and most information</strong> relevant for making decisions. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, the worst case of organizational decision-making happens when people with relevant information are not allowed to make decisions, while people who lack sufficient information make all decisions. Grounded Architecture aims to make relevant information more readily available to a broader audience and better connect people when making decisions.</p>

<div class="quote">
Grounded Architecture aims to make relevant information more readily available to a broader audience and better connect people when making decisions.
</div>

<p>While I aim to create a mechanism to give teams autonomy, autonomy does not mean that teams are alone, do not align with anyone, do not get feedback from anyone, and do whatever they want. Teams must complement <strong>autonomy</strong> with high <strong>transparency</strong> and <strong>proactivity</strong> in alignment with other groups.</p>

<p>I have sometimes implemented the concept of a <strong>decision pyramid</strong> (Figure 3) to give the teams <strong>maximal autonomy</strong> while maintaining a <strong>minimal</strong> level of <strong>global alignment</strong> and compatibility.</p>

<p>The <strong>decision pyramid</strong> highlights that development teams should make most decisions. However, several strategic and area-level choices may provide team decision boundaries. For example, selecting the public cloud provider is typically a CTO-level strategic decision. Similarly, engineering leaders in some areas may want to limit some choices, such as the number of programming languages, to more easily train new people, maintain code, and support moves between teams.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/decision-pyramid.png" alt="" />
<em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A decision pyramid. The development teams should make most decisions. However, several strategic and area-level decisions may provide decision boundaries for teams (e.g., golden paths or tech stack constraints).</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="general-architecture-decision-policy">General Architecture Decision Policy</h3>

<p>Distributed decision-making scales well, but it can lead to chaos if entirely uncoordinated. Some decision policies are needed. Inspired by the famous <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr">Netflix expense policy</a></strong>, <em>“Act in Netflix’s best interests”</em>, I frequently argued that architecture decision policy could similarly be summarized in six words: <em>“Decide in the Organization’s Best Interests.”</em></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/arch/decision-policy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I mean by that is that <strong>anyone can make architecture decisions</strong>, provided that, in addition to their specific requirements, they also think about the <strong>impact of their choices</strong> on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overall organizational complexity</strong>: Technology is more manageable by limiting tech diversity, size, and dependencies. Limiting technology choices reduces the attack surface with fewer third-party dependencies and tool ecosystems (build, testing, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of moving people</strong> between teams (both to get help and help others): Do not unnecessarily create exotic islands with few experts in technologies not supported or widely used in the organization. People cannot get help or move across the organization as their expertise may be useless outside the team.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of training and onboarding</strong> of internal and external developers: Using conventional technologies supported by external learning resources (e.g., books, tutorials) significantly helps find and grow experts.</li>
  <li><strong>Talent density</strong> and the possibility of performing at the world-scale level: Building world-scale technology and scaling requires in-depth knowledge and fine-tuning. You cannot achieve it with only a few in-house experts.</li>
  <li>New <strong>reorganizations</strong>: If the ownership of components changes (e.g., another team is taking it over), would your choices fit with other components from other areas?</li>
  <li>Reducing global <strong>duplication of effort</strong> and inefficiencies: Are you doing the work others are doing? Can others reuse your work? Can you reuse the work of others?</li>
</ul>

<p>While it may not always be enough, this simple policy can resonate well with many people and can encourage them to be more thoughtful when making decisions.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="golden-paths">Golden Paths</h3>

<p>I have found that the concept of Golden Paths provides an excellent ground to <strong>drive alignment and collaboration</strong> in architecture activities. Golden Paths is an approach utilized to streamline and unify the development process within a software ecosystem, aiming to tackle fragmentation and foster consistency, inspired by <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/">Spotify’s implementation</a>. Golden Paths can be described as “<strong>opinionated and supported</strong>” routes developers can follow to build systems efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p><img style="" src="assets/images/spotify-golden-paths_infrastructure-and-tooling-700x327.png" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by engineering.atspotify.com
</div>

<p>Golden paths provide a solid <strong>foundation for aligning</strong> architecture activities, serving as a common target of work for Guilds and central architectural teams. Rather than being solely knowledge-sharing entities, <strong>guilds</strong> can be empowered to <strong>develop golden paths,</strong> serving as an excellent catalyst for more effective community engagement. This approach not only enhances the role of guilds but also increases the adoption of golden paths as they are created collaboratively.</p>

<p>Golden Paths can be crucial to an organization’s IT development landscape as a deliberate and strategic effort to promote <strong>uniformity,</strong> <strong>efficiency,</strong> and <strong>reliability.</strong> By advocating for a set of preferred technologies and practices that are <strong>well-supported,</strong> <strong>secure,</strong> and aligned with the organization’s broader objectives, Golden Paths can guide developers to build less fragmented, and faster-to-develop software. Ultimately, this leads to higher-quality and more maintainable IT systems.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="embracing-diversity">Embracing Diversity</h2>

<p>When building architecture guilds and virtual architecture teams, it’s crucial to acknowledge that organizational units have diverse structures and sizes. In big organizations, <strong>embracing diversity</strong> is a prerequisite to having a broad impact.</p>

<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution for assigning architecture responsibilities within departments. Based on Gregor Hohpe’s view of architects and their teams’ relationships, I’ve generally encountered three types of team-architect systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Benevolent “dictator”</strong>: An architect or architecture team tells developers what to do or how to do things. The key nuance here is whether the communication is unidirectional or bi-directional.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Primus inter pares (first among equals)</strong>: Architects are embedded within teams where each is just another team member, but with a focus on the system structure and trade-offs and taking a longer-term view than other team members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Architecture without architects</strong>: Architecture is done within teams, but the task is a shared responsibility among multiple (or all) team members. This approach is often the preferred model in modern technology organizations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, there is no magic bullet. Different structures work for various organizations; sometimes, the best solution is a mix of these approaches.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="setting-boundaries">Setting Boundaries</h2>

<p>One of the amusing challenges with setting up an architecture practice in an organization is that everyone seems to have a different idea of what “architecture” should entail. It’s like asking people to describe a unicorn: some imagine a mythical, majestic creature, while others picture a sparkly horse with a horn that grants wishes. Good architects can do many things, but this versatility might not always be the most effective way to support the organization. We need to <strong>set boundaries</strong> so that we can focus on what’s important rather than becoming frazzled by what’s not.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-92285726.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To be effective, I’ve found it crucial to establish and clearly communicate some “<strong>rules of engagement</strong>” (ROE). Think of ROE as the office playbook for how architects should operate. In a corporate setting, ROE are the principles that guide how employees and departments interact with each other, clients, and stakeholders. This includes communication protocols, decision-making processes, and conflict-resolution mechanisms. Essentially, ROE sets the stage for what’s expected and what’s not, ensuring everyone plays nicely and fairly.</p>

<p>While you may need to tailor these rules to fit your organization, I found it helpful to set expectations for what the team should be able to do to qualify for the architecture support. Here’s a handy list of expectations for teams seeking architecture support. This also helps clarify what an architecture practice isn’t supposed to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organizational Awareness and Connections:</strong> Teams should know all relevant stakeholders and actively engage with them. This knowledge should include product, development, and business stakeholders. Planning should be collaborative across all affected teams, with active working relationships with global functions like QA, DevOps, or Security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enough Capacity and Skills:</strong> Teams should have adequate development capacity with the right skills and seniority to innovate and maintain their products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strategic Awareness:</strong> Teams should understand the organization’s strategic goals, technologies, and other relevant strategies, and know their role within these frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical Documentation Literacy:</strong> Teams should be capable of creating technical documentation, such as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) or RFCs (Request for Comments).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technology Standard Awareness:</strong> Teams should be familiar with the organization’s technology standards, including golden paths and guidelines for planning, documentation, security, DevOps, and QA processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Participation and Citizenship:</strong> Teams should actively participate in relevant communities (like architecture guilds) and global events (such as architecture summits).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tech Debt Management:</strong> Teams must be aware of the technical debt they create and maintain, ideally having a tech debt backlog and a plan for “paying” it back.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Aligning on these rules with the teams helps ensure productive conversations about architectural support. When these conditions are met, an architecture practice can help teams level up. When they’re not, architecture support can’t be as effective. However, that doesn’t mean struggling teams are left in the lurch. Architecture can help teams meet these expectations but can’t compensate for their total lack. Teams need to take the initiative and lead. For instance, it’s impractical to have architects working full-time for months with one team as their senior developer. However, architects can coach and help developers grow which is a more scalable appraoch. Similarly, architects can assist in building relationships with other teams, but the teams themselves need to be active and engaged.</p>

<p>So, set those expectations, establish your rules of engagement, and watch as your an architecture practice goes from a sparkly unicorn to a well-oiled machine!</p>

<p><br />
The book <a href="https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/organization-strategy/smart-simplicity">Six Simple Rules: How to Manage Complexity without Getting Complicated</a> by Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman offered fresh air for my vision of an architecture practice. Morieux and Tollman introduced the concept of <strong>Smart Simplicity</strong> with six rules or strategies that enable organizations to promote new behaviors and improve performance. The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes that in today’s business environment, you need to set up <strong>organizational structures based on cooperation</strong>.</p>

<div class="quote">
In today's complicated business environments, you must set up organizational structures based on cooperation.
</div>

<p>The authors developed the Six Simple Rules approach as a practical solution for today’s complex business environment. The rules in the book are based on the premise that the key to managing complexity is the <strong>combination of autonomy and cooperation.</strong> The book advocates for the setup of organizational structures that harmonize, empowering individuals with more autonomy to act. This approach is about trusting the capabilities of the organization’s people to handle complex problems, fostering a cooperative and efficient work environment.</p>

<p>In this chapter, I explore how Grounded Architecture and Six Simple Rules are best friends. The Six Simple Rules ideas have been a significant source of inspiration for my work. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html"><strong>Conway’s Law</strong></a> shows that the link between organizational structures and IT architecture is like peanut butter and jelly—strong and better together. The Six Simple Rules approach and architectural work are all about managing complexity without getting tangled up.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="background-hard-and-soft-management">Background: Hard and Soft Management</h2>

<p>One of the Six Simple Rules’ central premises is that <strong>conventional management approaches</strong>, which the authors split into hard and soft, are neither sufficient nor appropriate for the complexity of organizations nowadays.</p>

<h3 id="hard-approach">Hard Approach</h3>

<p>The <strong>hard approach</strong> rests on two fundamental assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first is the belief that <strong>structures, processes, and systems</strong> have a direct and predictable effect on performance, and as long as managers pick the right ones, they will get the performance they want.</li>
  <li>The second assumption is that the <strong>human factor is the weakest and least reliable link</strong> of the organization and that it is essential to <strong>control people’s behavior through the proliferation of rules</strong> to specify their actions and through financial incentives linked to carefully designed metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to motivate them to perform in the way the organization wants them to.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the company needs to meet new performance requirements, the <strong>hard response</strong> is to <strong>add new structures, processes, and systems</strong> to help satisfy those requirements. Hence, introducing the innovation czar, the risk management team, the compliance unit, the customer-centricity leader, and the cohort of coordinators and interfaces have become so common in companies.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-936995400.jpg" alt="" /></p>

</div>

<p>In my experience, IT architecture support  in organizations following a hard management approach has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heavy Reliance on Tools:</strong> The architecture would focus on tools, automation, and workflows that <strong>enforce compliance,</strong> standardization, and control. There might be a strong reliance on enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, centralized data warehouses, and other structured tools that enable <strong>strict adherence</strong> to predefined processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> There would be a significant emphasis on <strong>compliance frameworks,</strong> security protocols, and risk management systems. These systems would be designed to ensure that all actions are traceable, compliant with regulations, and aligned with the company’s <strong>predefined rules and processes.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Bureaucratic Systems:</strong> The architecture might include multiple <strong>layers of control</strong> and coordination units, such as a risk management system, compliance databases, and innovation management software. Each of these units would be designed to enforce specific aspects of the organization’s performance objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="soft-approach">Soft Approach</h3>

<p>On the other end, we have a soft management approach. According to the <strong>soft approach</strong>, an organization is a set of <strong>interpersonal relationships and the sentiments</strong> that govern them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good performance is the by-product of good interpersonal relationships</strong>. Personal traits, psychological needs, and mindsets predetermine people’s actions.</li>
  <li>To change behavior at work, you need to <strong>change the mindset (or change the people)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1482584637.jpg" alt="" /></p>

</div>

<p>In my experience, IT architecture support in organizations following a soft management approach has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employee Empowerment:</strong> Systems would likely be designed to empower employees by providing the tools they need to <strong>succeed independently,</strong> such as access to real-time data, <strong>self-service</strong> analytics, and systems that encourage innovation and creativity.</li>
  <li><strong>Employee-Centric:</strong> The architecture would focus on tools facilitating communication and <strong>knowledge sharing.</strong> These tools might include <strong>collaboration platforms,</strong> social intranets, and user-friendly interfaces that enable employees to interact more effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Systems might be more personalized, offering <strong>customization options</strong> that align with individual preferences and needs. This personalization could include customizable dashboards and personalized workspaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="collaboration-approach">Collaboration Approach</h2>

<p>Hard and soft management approaches are limited in today’s world and are harmful to cooperation. A <strong>hard approach</strong> introduces <strong>complicated mechanisms</strong>, compliance, and “checking the box” behaviors instead of the engagement and initiative to make things work. The <strong>soft approach’s</strong> emphasis on <strong>good interpersonal feelings</strong> creates <strong>cooperation obstacles</strong> as people want to maintain good feelings.</p>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes that in today’s business environment, you must set up <strong>organizational structures based on cooperation</strong>. More specifically, the Six Simple Rules approach involves the interplay of <strong>autonomy</strong> and <strong>cooperation</strong>. The authors emphasize the critical difference between autonomy and self-sufficiency. <strong>Autonomy</strong> is about fully mobilizing our intelligence and energy to <strong>influence outcomes</strong>, including those <strong>we do not entirely control</strong>. <strong>Self-sufficiency</strong> is about <strong>limiting our efforts</strong> only to those outcomes that we <strong>control entirely without depending</strong> on others. Autonomy is essential for coping with complexity; <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> is an obstacle because it <strong>hinders the cooperation</strong> needed to make autonomy effective.</p>

<p>The first three rules create the conditions for <strong>individual autonomy and empowerment</strong> to improve performance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understand what your people do</strong>. Trace performance back to behaviors and how they influence overall results. Understand the context of goals, resources, and constraints. Determine how an organization’s elements shape goals, resources, and constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforce integrators</strong>. Identify integrators—those individuals or units whose influence makes a difference in the work of others—by looking for points of tension where people are doing the hard work of cooperating. Integrators bring others together and drive processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase the total quantity of power</strong>. When creating new roles in the organization, empower them to make decisions without taking power away from others.</li>
</ul>

<p>This difference between <strong>Autonomy</strong> and <strong>Self-Sufficiency</strong> leads us to the second set of rules that compels people to confront complexity and use their newfound autonomy to cooperate with others so that <strong>overall performance, not just individual performance</strong>, is radically improved.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase reciprocity</strong>. Set clear objectives that stimulate mutual interest to cooperate. Make each person’s success dependent on the success of others. Eliminate monopolies, reduce resources, and create new networks of interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Extend the shadow of the future</strong>. Have people experience the consequences that result from their behavior and decisions. Tighten feedback loops. Shorten the duration of projects. Enable people to see how their success is aided by contributing to the success of others.</li>
  <li><strong>Reward those who cooperate</strong>. Increase the payoff for all when they cooperate in a beneficial way. Establish penalties for those who fail to cooperate.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-1-understand-what-your-people-do">Rule 1: Understand What Your People Do</h2>

<p>The first rule states that you must genuinely understand performance: <strong>what people do</strong> and <strong>why they do it</strong>. When you know why people do what they do and how it drives performance, you can define the minimum sufficient set of <strong>interventions with surgical accuracy</strong>.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-understanding-performance">Guidelines for Understanding Performance</h3>

<p>To genuinely understand performance, consider the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trace performance back to behaviors, understanding how these behaviors influence and combine to produce overall results.</li>
  <li>Utilize observation, mapping, measurement, and discussion to gain insights.</li>
  <li>Comprehend the context of goals, resources, and constraints within which current behaviors are rational strategies for people.</li>
  <li>Discover how your organization’s elements—structure, scorecards, systems, and incentives—shape these goals, resources, and constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leveraging-architecture-practice">Leveraging Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can significantly aid in understanding organizational behaviors through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establishing a <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> with an overview of various data sources to reveal where activities occur, visible trends, and cooperation among people.</li>
  <li>Utilizing the <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> to connect individuals and enable them to learn about activities in different parts of the organization.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-2-reinforce-integrators">Rule 2: Reinforce Integrators</h2>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes the importance of reinforcing integrators by looking at those <strong>directly involved in the work</strong>, giving them <strong>power and interest to foster cooperation in dealing with complexity</strong> instead of resorting to the paraphernalia of overarching hierarchies, overlays, dedicated interfaces, balanced scorecards, or coordination procedures.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-reinforcing-integrators">Guidelines for Reinforcing Integrators</h3>

<p>To strengthen integrators within your organization, consider these strategies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use emotions</strong> to identify candidates. Feelings provide crucial clues for analysis and can act as symptoms of integration issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Identify operational units</strong> that can be integrators among peer units due to their specific interests or power.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove managerial layers</strong> that do not add value and reinforce others as integrators by eliminating specific rules and relying on observation and judgment over metrics when cooperation is involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enhancing-integrators-through-architecture-practice">Enhancing Integrators Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can play a vital role in reinforcing integrators by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Utilizing the <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> to help identify and connect integrators, leveraging their work effectively.</li>
  <li>Emphasizing architects as critical integrators and integrator role models within the organization, defining them as essential components of the organizational “<a href="superglue">superglue</a>.”</li>
  <li>Establishing a <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> to support integrators with data and insights, enabling them to perform more informed and effective work.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-3-increase-the-total-quantity-of-power">Rule 3: Increase the Total Quantity of Power</h2>

<p>Whenever you consider an <strong>addition to</strong> your organization’s <strong>structure, processes, and systems</strong>, think about <strong>increasing the quantity of power</strong>. Doing so may <strong>save you from increasing complicatedness</strong> and enable you to achieve a more significant impact with less cost. You can increase the quantity of power by allowing some functions to influence performance and stakes that matter to others.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1201215883.jpg" alt="" /></p>

</div>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-increasing-power-quantity">Guidelines for Increasing Power Quantity</h3>

<p>To enhance the quantity of power within your organization, consider these actions recommended by the Six Simple Rules approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When making design decisions that could shift the balance between central and unit power, functions, and line managers, ensure that some parts of the <strong>organization benefit from new power bases.</strong> This approach helps meet complexity requirements and avoids future disruptions from pendulum swings.</li>
  <li>When creating new functions, ensure they have the power to fulfill their roles <strong>without diminishing the power others need</strong> to fulfill theirs.</li>
  <li>When introducing new tools for managers, such as planning or evaluation systems, evaluate whether these tools <strong>act as resources or constraints.</strong> Implementing a few tools creates a critical mass of power, which is more effective than introducing many tools sequentially.</li>
  <li>Regularly <strong>enrich power bases</strong> to maintain agility, flexibility, and adaptability.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enhancing-power-quantity-through-architecture-practice">Enhancing Power Quantity Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can support the increase in power quantity through an operating model that promotes distributed decision-making:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Through the <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong>, you can enhance decision-making power by distributing architectural decision-making across the organization and embedding it within development teams, which typically have the best insights and most relevant information.</li>
  <li>Additionally, <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong>, accessible to all interested members of the organization, can provide data and insights that empower individuals in their daily work.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-4-increase-reciprocity">Rule 4: Increase Reciprocity</h2>

<p>In the face of business complexity, work is becoming more interdependent. To meet multiple and often contradictory performance requirements, <strong>people must rely more on each other</strong>. They need to <strong>cooperate directly</strong> instead of depending on dedicated interfaces, coordination structures, or procedures that only add to complicatedness.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-enhancing-reciprocity">Guidelines for Enhancing Reciprocity</h3>

<p>Reciprocity involves recognizing that people or units in an organization have a mutual interest in cooperation and that the success of one depends on the success of others. To foster this reciprocity, follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Eliminate monopolies</strong> to ensure no single entity has exclusive control.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce resources</strong> to encourage more efficient and collaborative use.</li>
  <li><strong>Create new networks</strong> of interaction to facilitate better communication and cooperation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enhancing-reciprocity-through-architecture-practice">Enhancing Reciprocity Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can significantly increase reciprocity within an organization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> supports creating new networks of interactions, directly reinforcing reciprocity.</li>
  <li>A <a href="operating-model">hybrid operating model</a> relies on the mutual success of an architecture practice and development teams. Architects’ <a href="impact">impact</a> is essential, and their support depends on the feedback from the groups they assist. Integrating this feedback into architects’ performance evaluations is crucial for enhancing reciprocity between architecture and other units.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-5-extend-the-shadow-of-the-future">Rule 5: Extend the Shadow of the Future</h2>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes the importance of making visible and clear <strong>what happens tomorrow as a consequence of what they do today</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-extending-the-shadow-of-the-future">Guidelines for Extending the Shadow of the Future</h3>

<p>The Six Simple Rules approach recommends four strategies to extend the shadow of the future:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tighten the feedback loop</strong> by increasing the frequency of moments when people experience the consequences of the fit between their contributions.</li>
  <li><strong>Bring the endpoint forward</strong> by shortening the duration of projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Tie futures together</strong> so that successful moves are conditioned on contributing to the success of others.</li>
  <li>Ensure people <strong>walk in the shoes they make</strong> for others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extending-the-shadow-of-the-future-through-architecture-practice">Extending the Shadow of the Future Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can play a crucial role in extending the shadow of the future through various methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> can create transparency and provide the data necessary to model the future. This data can be used to develop simulations and roadmap options.</li>
  <li>Applying <strong><a href="economics">economic modeling</a></strong> to architecture decision-making helps describe the future consequences of today’s actions, directly supporting long-term planning and decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="rule-6-reward-those-who-cooperate">Rule 6: Reward Those Who Cooperate</h2>

<p>Lastly, the Six Simple Rules approach recommends that when you cannot create direct feedback loops embedded in people’s tasks, you need <strong>management’s intervention to close the loop</strong>. Managers must then use the familiar performance evaluation tool but in a very different way to reward those who cooperate.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-rewarding-cooperation">Guidelines for Rewarding Cooperation</h3>

<p>To effectively reward those who cooperate, managers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Go beyond technical criteria</strong> and avoid placing blame solely on where the root cause originated. Accept that execution problems arise from various reasons. The smart approach is to reduce rewards for those who <strong>fail to cooperate</strong> in solving a problem, even if the problem isn’t in their direct area, and increase rewards for units that cooperate beneficially.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid blaming failure</strong> and instead focus on blaming the inability to <strong>help or seek help.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Use simple questions</strong> to shift managerial conversations, making transparency and ambitious targets resources rather than constraints. This approach helps managers act as integrators, <strong>leveraging cooperation</strong> and rich information to achieve superior results.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rewarding-cooperation-through-architecture-practice">Rewarding Cooperation Through Architecture Practice</h3>

<p>Architecture practice can facilitate rewarding cooperation by making it easier for individuals to help others and ask for help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A strong <strong><a href="people">Collaborative Networks</a></strong> can provide the context and networks necessary for easier collaboration.</li>
  <li>Adding diverse data sources to <strong><a href="analytics">Lightweight Architectural Analytics</a></strong> can create transparency about cooperation opportunities and challenges, supporting a more collaborative environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Over the past year, like many others I’ve been exploring how <strong>Generative AI</strong> can make my work as an IT Architect faster, more innovative, and frankly, a lot more interesting. If you’re like me—juggling strategy, system design, governance, innovation, and endless documentation—you know how easy it is to get buried in manual tasks.</p>

<p>I’ve found that used wisely, AI fits perfectly into the <strong>Grounded Architecture</strong> mindset: staying connected to real-world needs, working with actual data, and avoiding ivory-tower abstractions. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned, reflecting the views of many others, is this: <strong>AI won’t replace architects; they’ll be replaced by architects who know how to leverage AI (and perhaps more importantly, know how not to).</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, I’ll share how I use generative AI today: streamlining documentation, speeding up decision-making, improving design, supporting governance, fueling innovation, and even enhancing modeling. I’ll keep it practical, grounded, and real—just as Grounded Architecture teaches us.</p>

<p>In the <a href="gen-ai-potential">Appendix: Deep Dive: Generative AI Potential for IT Architecture</a> you can find a more detailed overview of the potential of Generative AI for IT Architecture. In this chapter, I want to share my practical experiences and insights on how to leverage AI effectively in our field.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="streamlining-documentation-with-ai">Streamlining Documentation with AI</h2>

<p>One of the first areas where AI greatly impacted me was <strong>documentation</strong>. The writing workload can get overwhelming, whether it’s requirements, design specs, ADRs, or standards.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1975281324.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Here’s how I use AI day-to-day:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First drafts:</strong> I’ll throw in bullet points about a design and let AI generate a draft document. It saves me 50–70% of the time it would normally take to write from scratch.</li>
  <li><strong>Summarizing long texts:</strong> When stakeholders send me 40-page reports, AI will summarize them into key points for quick decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality reviews:</strong> I’ve trained AI to act like a junior reviewer. It spots vague requirements (“handle a large number of users”) and reminds me to be specific (“10,000 concurrent users, peak”).</li>
  <li><strong>Updating live documents:</strong> If I get new info from a project team or monitoring reports, AI helps me update architecture descriptions without starting over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it doesn’t replace my judgment. I always review AI’s output carefully. But it does take the heavy lifting off my plate so that I can focus on <strong>thinking,</strong> not typing.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="using-ai-to-accelerate-decision-making">Using AI to Accelerate Decision-Making</h2>

<p>Architects live and die by decisions: tech choices, patterns, risk tradeoffs. Generative AI has become my “research sidekick.”</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-2067248129.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/NicoElNino">NicoElNino</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

<p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comparing options:</strong> You’ll feed AI a question like, “Should we use a monolith or microservices for this project?” It spits out pros, cons, and considerations tailored to my context.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost and performance analysis:</strong> You can upload billing data or performance logs for cloud optimization, and AI highlights trends, waste, and quick wins. It cuts hours of spreadsheet work into minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Business translation:</strong> When advising executives, you can ask AI to help frame tech decisions in business terms: “How does this solution affect uptime, costs, and customer satisfaction?”</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re still making the calls. AI just helps you gather better inputs—faster.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="enhancing-design-and-ideation-with-ai">Enhancing Design and Ideation with AI</h2>

<p>Designing systems is where AI becomes a real partner, not just an assistant.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-1221296734.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>When starting on a fresh architecture, you can ask AI open-ended questions like, <em>“What are possible designs for a real-time inventory system?”</em> It usually throws back several patterns—microservices, event sourcing, modular monoliths—with pros and cons you can chew on.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it suggests ideas you wouldn’t have thought of immediately. It’s like brainstorming with a very fast, well-read junior architect who’s read every case study under the sun.</p>

<p>You can also use AI for quick <strong>sanity checks</strong>. After sketching a design, you’ll describe it to the AI and ask, <em>“What security risks or bottlenecks should I watch for?”</em> It almost always surfaces helpful something—like reminding me to load-balance a service you had overlooked.</p>

<p>If you’re stuck, you’ll have it generate sample code snippets, database schema ideas, or system diagrams. It’s not perfect, but it gives me something to react to, accelerating my creative flow.</p>

<p>In short, AI makes me a <em>faster, sharper designer</em>—without taking away my ownership of the architecture.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="improving-governance-and-compliance-with-ai">Improving Governance and Compliance with AI</h2>

<p>Governance isn’t the sexiest part of architecture, but it’s critical—and AI helps me manage it without getting buried.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-2160417380.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">
Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/en/portfolio/Alexander_Supertramp">Alexander Supertramp</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">iStock</a>
</div>

<p>For example, when you review a solution design, you can feed the AI the architecture description and ask it to check for gaps against our security or cloud standards. It acts like a first-pass reviewer, flagging missing backup strategies, single points of failure, or vague service descriptions.</p>

<p>You can also use AI to <strong>summarize security scans</strong> or compliance reports. Instead of digging through 100-page vulnerability lists, you get a clean executive summary: top risks, quick wins, and major concerns.</p>

<p>Another trick you can use: training AI on our internal policies, so teams can ask simple questions like, <em>“What’s the standard for API security?”</em> and get a straight answer instantly. It democratizes governance without adding bureaucratic overhead.</p>

<p>The bottom line: AI helps me enforce standards without being a bottleneck and lets me spend more time on critical decisions rather than paperwork.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="supporting-innovation-and-strategy-with-ai">Supporting Innovation and Strategy with AI</h2>

<p>When you’re working on <em>innovation</em>—scouting new tech, designing future states, proposing bold ideas—AI is a fantastic thought partner.</p>

<p>You can prompt it with questions like, <em>“How could blockchain improve our supply chain transparency?”</em> or <em>“What might edge computing enable for our IoT strategy?”</em> It often gives me 4–5 solid ideas plus some practical risks to watch out for.</p>

<p>You can also use AI to draft mini-business cases when you pitch new initiatives. If you describe an idea, AI can help outline benefits, risks, costs, and strategic alignment. It’s not the final analysis, but it gives me a running start.</p>

<p>AI lowers the barrier for more people to join innovation conversations. A business analyst, a product owner, or even a junior dev can sketch ideas with AI’s help, then bring them into architecture discussions. It spreads creativity beyond the architecture team.</p>

<p>AI can multiply human ingenuity.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="augmenting-modeling-and-analysis-with-ai">Augmenting Modeling and Analysis with AI</h2>

<p>Keeping architecture models updated used to be one of my least favorite chores. Now, with AI, it’s far more dynamic and collaborative.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/istock/iStock-2185931941.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="font-size: 70%; margin-top: -16px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 12px">

</div>

<p>Today, You can often describe systems or processes in plain English—and AI helps draft architecture diagrams, component lists, or relationship maps. It’s imperfect, but it saves hours of clicking in modeling tools.</p>

<p>More excitingly, you can start to <strong>query architecture models in natural language</strong>. Instead of manually hunting through layers of diagrams, I can ask, <em>“Which apps handle customer orders?”</em> and get a simple answer.</p>

<p>When models drift from reality, you can feed AI up-to-date infrastructure data (like cloud configs or microservice registries), and it suggests updates for the architecture view. It’s like having an architecture auditor who never gets tired.</p>

<p>Even better, AI helps <strong>translate models for different audiences</strong>. From a technical diagram, you can draft a business capability map for executives or a deployment diagram for engineers—without manually redrawing everything.</p>

<p>These translations mean my architecture stays <em>living, accessible, and grounded in reality</em>as it should be.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-staying-grounded-using-ai">Final Thoughts: Staying Grounded Using AI</h2>

<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that <strong>Generative AI is a tool, not a replacement</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s great at speeding up documentation, surfacing insights, brainstorming options, and checking compliance. But it doesn’t understand context, strategy, or business nuance like I do. If I’m not careful, it can hallucinate or miss critical subtleties.</p>

<p>So, I treat AI like a junior partner: fast, smart, helpful, but always needing my judgment and leadership. I prompt it carefully, review its output rigorously, and make the final decisions.</p>

<p>Used this way, AI doesn’t make architecture less important—it makes <strong>good architecture even more valuable</strong>. It frees me up to focus on tangible business outcomes, strategic design, and connecting systems to human needs.</p>

<p>In short, just like Grounded Architecture, Generative AI helps me stay more <strong>grounded</strong>, more impactful, and (honestly) a lot more excited about the future of architecture.</p>

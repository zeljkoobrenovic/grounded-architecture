## Introductions

### TL;DR Experimental Podcast
### Introduction
> * This book will share my approach to running an IT architecture practice in larger organizations based on my experience at AVIV Group, eBay Classifieds, and Adevinta. I call this approach "Grounded Architecture"—architecture with strong foundations and deep roots.
> * Prioritizing people interactions and data over processes and tools, Grounded Architecture aims to connect an architecture practice to all organizational levels as an antidote to the "ivory tower" architecture.
> * I also explain my motivation to write this book.

### Context: Fast-Moving Global Organizations
> * To better understand any idea or solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which this idea developed. 
> * The Grounded Architecture approach has evolved in the context of global, loosely coupled organizations that are diverse, with nonlinear growth dynamics, and under transformation pressures. 

### Goals: Adapting, Growing, and Using Data
> * I identified the following needs that an architecture practice should support: Executing At Scale, Adaptivity, Improving the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, and Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning.

## Grounded Architecture Framework

### Lightweight Architectural Analytics
> * Lightweight Architectural Analytics serves as a medium to create a complete, up-to-date picture of critical elements of the organization's technology landscapes. 
> * Such analytics provides an architecture-centric view of data about a technology landscape based on source code analyses, public cloud billing reports, vibrancy reports, or incident tickets.
> * To facilitate the creation of Lightweight Architectural Analytics, I have been creating open-source tools that can help you obtain valuable architectural insights from data sources, such as source code repositories. Check out open-source [architecture dashboard examples](https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/grounded-architecture-dashboard-examples/) and [Sokrates](https://sokrates.dev).

### Collaborative Networks
> * Developing an architecture practice requires having competent, empowered, and motivated architects. An an architecture practice must carefully organize, empower, and leverage scarce talent.
> * In my work in the past few years, I combined two teams of architects: a small central architecture team and a cross-organizational distributed virtual team.

### Operating Model: General Principles
> * The Operating Model is a system of processes and agreements enabling architects to do everything architecture typically does, leveraging Lightweight Architectural Analytics and Collaborative Networks to create a data-informed, organization-wide impact.
> * Examples of activities include: supporting teams in their daily work; tracking tech debt; performing technical due diligence; standardizing processes and documentation; defining cloud, data, and platform strategies.

### Cooperation-Based Operating Model: Six Simple Rules
> * The Six Simple Rules approach emphasizes that in today’s complicated business environment, you must set up organizational structures based on cooperation. 
> * To deal with complexity, organizations should depend on the judgment of their people and on these people cooperating. 
> * This view is well aligned with the ideas of Grounded Architecture.

### Operating Model: Nudge, Taxation, Mandates
> * Architecture practice should support governance models adaptable to organizations' complex and diverse needs. A technology governance model should be a well-balanced hybrid of three different styles of governing: mandates and bans, taxes, and nudging.
> * Nudging is a form of governing where you create subtle or indirect suggestions influencing someone's behavior or decision-making without forcing them or limiting their freedom of choice.
> * Governing with taxes (economic incentives) is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to "pay" some form of taxes on used resources.
> * With mandates and bans, you guide people by explicitly defining what they should or should not do.

### Transforming Organizations with Grounded Architecture
> * When a Grounded Architecture framework is in place, it can positively transform an organization's functioning.
> * These impact categories are Executing At Scale, Improving the Quality of Decision-Making with Data, Maximizing Organizational Alignment & Learning, and Higher Adaptivity.

### Next Steps: Leveraging The Potential of Generative AI
> * Generative AI (GenAI) offers significant potential to augment your work as an IT architect by enhancing data analysis (Lightweight Analytics), improving knowledge sharing (Collaborative Networks), and streamlining tasks (Operating Model).
> * Practical applications include accelerating analytics, generating ADRs and diagrams, augmenting requirements analysis, assisting solution design, improving code reviews, and drafting communications, ultimately freeing you up for higher-value strategic thinking.
> * While GenAI promises increased efficiency, consistency, and better data-driven decisions, you must navigate challenges like accuracy issues (hallucinations), security risks, ethical considerations (bias), and the need for continuous human oversight and judgment.
> * Responsible adoption requires a principled approach focusing on clear objectives, strong data governance, human-in-the-loop validation, grounding AI with RAG, and fostering an AI-literate culture within your organization.
> * The future points towards real-time, augmented EA, agentic AI, and DTOs, further emphasizing the need for adaptability and evolving your role towards governing AI and focusing on strategic, collaborative, and ethical considerations.

## On Being Architect

### Thinking Like an Architect: Architects as Superglue
> * Architects in IT organizations should develop as “superglue,” people who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.
> * Architects need to be technically strong. But their unique strengths should stem from being able to relate technical issues with business and broader issues.

### Architects' Career Paths
> * A strong engineering background is essential for architects to make informed technology decisions and build effective relationships with developer teams.
> * Moving from an engineering role to an architecture role involves broadening scope, increasing diversity, and developing strong communication and influencer skills.
> * Career tracks can include Senior Architects (broader responsibilities), Principal Architects (specialized focus), and Enterprise Architects (aligning technical strategy with business objectives).
> * Architecture roles can lead to tech leadership positions such as Engineering Director or Chief Technology Officer (CTO), leveraging strategic vision, decision-making, and leadership skills.

### Building Skills
> * An architect's typical skillset includes hard (technical) skills, soft (people & social) skills, product development, business skills, and decision-making skills.
> * Hard (technical) skills are essential for designing, implementing, and maintaining an organization's technology landscape.
> * Soft skills are integral to social architecture, enabling individuals to navigate and contribute to these social systems effectively.

### Making Impact
> * Architects' work is evaluated based on their impact on the organization. 
> * Architects can make an impact via three pillars: Big-Picture Thinking, Execution, and Leveling-Up.

### Leadership Traits
> * My view of architecture leadership is inspired by David Marquet's work and Netflix's valued behaviors.
> * Marquet focused on leadership and organizational management, particularly emphasizing the principles of Intent-Based Leadership.
> * Borrowing from Netflix's original values, I see the following behavioral traits as crucial for architects: communication, judgment, impact, inclusion, selflessness, courage, integrity, curiosity, innovation, and passion.

### Leading with Language: Six Plays for Grounded IT Architects
> * IT Architects can significantly enhance their leadership and influence by adopting six key communication "plays" from David Marquet's "Leadership is Language," moving beyond outdated Industrial Age command-and-control styles.
> * These plays—Control the Clock, Collaborate, Commit, Complete, Improve, and Connect—provide practical linguistic tools to foster better thinking (Bluework), more effective execution (Redwork), and stronger team engagement.
> * Applying these plays helps architects build trust, flatten power gradients, encourage psychological safety, and unlock discretionary effort, leading to more robust architectural solutions and greater buy-in.
> * The principles align directly with a "Grounded Architecture" approach by promoting data-driven decisions, collaborative networks, adaptability, and strategic impact within organizations.
> * By consciously changing their language, architects can cultivate a more innovative, resilient, and effective engineering culture.

### Balancing Curiosity, Doubt, Vision, and Skepticism
> * **Curiosity and wonder** spark exploration, leading to technological breakthroughs. However, without caution, it can result in premature adoption of immature solutions.
> * **Doubt** forces a critical evaluation of progress, ensuring that innovative ideas are grounded in practical and validated approaches. Over-reliance on doubt can stifle risk-taking and hinder breakthrough innovation.
> * **Vision and belief** provide a long-term perspective, guiding efforts toward significant, transformative goals. Yet unchecked vision can lead to confirmation bias or misdirected resources.
> * **Skepticism** helps prevent overcommitment to unproven ideas, ensuring teams remain grounded. However, excessive skepticism can result in missed opportunities and discourage creative risk-taking.

## On Human Complexity

### The Culture Map: Architects' Culture Compass
> * I have found the work of Erin Meyer, The Culture Map, to be a beneficial tool for architects to work harmoniously with people from various cultures and backgrounds.
> * Meyer’s model contains eight scales, each representing a key area, showing how cultures vary from extreme to extreme: Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling.

### The Human Side of Decision-Making
> * Decision-making is a human activity subject to human biases and limitations. 
> * Fundamental biases influencing decision-making include outcome, hindsight, and confirmation biases.
> * Human intuition plays a vital role in decision-making.

### Effortless Architecture
> * Greg McKeown's "Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most" advocates for a paradigm shift from hard work to smart, effective work by simplifying tasks and processes. 
> * Key principles include prioritizing important tasks, leveraging automation, and embracing a mindset that values ease and enjoyment in work.
> * Greg McKeown's book offers invaluable insights that are particularly relevant for IT architects and software engineers. McKeown's emphasis on simplifying tasks and processes is crucial in the tech industry, where complexity often dominates. 

### On Strategy
### Enterprise Architecture as Strategy
> * Business Operating Models: Organizations can structure their IT and business processes around four models—Diversification, Coordination, Replication, and Unification—depending on their need for standardization and integration.
> * Global vs. Local Flexibility: Companies must balance global efficiency with local adaptability by implementing modular architectures and governance structures that support both.
> * Stages of IT and Strategy Alignment: Organizations evolve from business silos (fragmented systems) to business modularity (strategic agility), with increasing levels of IT-business integration.
> * IT’s Strategic Role: IT architecture serves as a key enabler for business execution, operational efficiency, and innovation, requiring alignment with the company's operating model and strategic goals.
> * Evolving IT Maturity: Progressing through IT maturity stages demands investment in technology, governance, and cultural shifts, ensuring seamless integration between business and IT functions.

### Hunting the Ghost of Business Architecture
> * Business architecture is a loosely defined, often invisible discipline that spans strategy, operations, design, and technology — making it hard to pin down or assign to a single owner.
> * There’s ongoing debate about whether it exists as a standalone function or if it's simply a set of shared perspectives and practices scattered across roles.
> * Different roles shape business architecture in different ways — from enterprise architects and COOs to service designers and heads of strategy — often without using the term.
> * Rather than centralizing ownership, the most effective approach could be shared stewardship, where multiple teams contribute to a common understanding of how the business works and changes.
> * Ultimately, business architecture may be less about definitions and more about creating clarity — helping organizations see the whole, make better decisions, and connect intent with execution.

### Outsourcing Strategies
> * Strategic Outsourcing: Long-term partnerships that drive innovation and align with business goals, requiring strong governance and integration with IT architecture.
> * Co-Sourcing: A collaborative model where internal and external expertise is blended for shared responsibility, requiring well-defined roles, governance structures, and architectural oversight.
> * Transactional Outsourcing: A cost-driven approach focused on routine, non-strategic tasks, emphasizing efficiency, automation, and seamless integration with enterprise systems.
> * IT Architecture’s Role: Ensures strategic alignment, interoperability, governance, risk management, and smooth integration of outsourced capabilities.
> * Strategy Selection: Organizations should choose an outsourcing model based on their operational maturity, business objectives, and the criticality of the outsourced function.

### Achieving Market Leadership
> * Market Leadership Strategies: Companies must choose between operational excellence, product leadership, or customer intimacy as their primary focus, while maintaining baseline competence in the other areas.
> * Operational Excellence & IT Architecture: Requires automation, process optimization, and cost-efficient technology solutions such as ERP and supply chain management.
> * Product Leadership & IT Architecture: Emphasizes agility, rapid innovation, and integration of research, analytics, and collaboration tools.
> * Customer Intimacy & IT Architecture: Focuses on personalized customer experiences, requiring robust CRM systems, data analytics, and seamless omnichannel integration.
> * Strategic IT Alignment: IT architecture must be designed to support and reinforce the company's strategic choice while remaining adaptable to market changes.

### Value-Based Strategy
> * Value-Based Strategy prioritizes initiatives that create value for customers (raising WTP), employees (improving work conditions), and suppliers (reducing costs).
> * Reducing Complexity: Eliminating redundant systems and focusing on fewer, high-impact IT initiatives increases efficiency and strategic alignment.
> * Enhancing Customer Experience: Seamless digital interactions, personalization, and high availability improve customer satisfaction and increase their willingness to pay (WTP).
> * Improving Employee Productivity: Automation, better tools, and flexible work arrangements enhance job satisfaction and reduce friction.
> * Optimizing Supplier Relationships: IT-driven supply chain efficiencies reduce suppliers' costs and improve business partnerships.
> * Leveraging IT for Ecosystems & Complementary Value: API-driven platforms and integrated digital services enhance core business offerings.
> * Supporting Business Model Shifts: Adaptable IT architectures enable companies to pivot to new revenue streams (e.g., SaaS, cloud computing, AI-driven services).

### Marketplace Strategies: What Digital Marketplaces Sell?
> * Digital marketplaces act as intermediaries, not direct sellers, providing trust, efficiency, and infrastructure.
> * Their core value proposition is reducing transaction costs across search, negotiation, and enforcement.
> * Different monetization models include commission fees, paid subscriptions, promoted listings, and value-added services.
> * The IT architecture of marketplaces focuses on scalability, automation, security, and seamless multi-sided interactions.
> * Technologies like AI, cloud computing, and API-driven ecosystems enhance marketplace efficiency and reliability.

### Connecting Marketing, Sales, and Customer Service Strategies
> * Seamless Integration of Marketing, Sales, and Customer Care – IT architects ensure that CRM, marketing automation, analytics, and e-commerce platforms are well-integrated to eliminate silos and enhance efficiency.
> * Data-Driven Decision Making – Customer data platforms (CDPs) and AI analytics provide actionable insights that personalize engagement and improve customer acquisition and retention.
> * Automation & AI for Efficiency – AI-driven chatbots, predictive analytics, and automated lead nurturing improve customer interactions and sales effectiveness.
> * Security & Compliance – IT architecture must protect customer data privacy by ensuring compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and securing third-party integrations.
> * Scalability & Performance Optimization – IT systems should support business growth by enabling flexible, high-performance digital platforms for expanding marketing and sales operations.

### Culture As a Strategy (aka Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast)
> * Culture Defines Organizational Behavior & Decision-Making – Shared values, behaviors, and norms shape how strategies are executed and influence IT initiatives.
> * Cultural Styles Impact IT Architecture – Different cultures (e.g., results-driven, caring, learning-focused) dictate whether IT prioritizes performance, collaboration, security, or innovation.
> * Alignment Between IT Architecture & Culture – IT architects must tailor system designs, governance, and workflows to fit their organization's cultural environment.
> * Balancing Cultural Trade-Offs – Blended cultures (e.g., safety & learning, results & caring) require careful navigation to balance efficiency, risk-taking, and collaboration.
> * IT Architects as Cultural Influencers – Architects shape and adapt to organizational culture, ensuring technology strategy aligns with both business goals and cultural dynamics.

## Expanding the Architect's Toolkit: Learning From Other Fields

### Economic Modeling With ROI and Financial Options: Learning From the Finance Field
> * Architects are frequently asked about the (economic) value of architecture or technology investments.
> * Answering this question is a crucial skill for any senior architect. However, answering it concisely and convincingly to a non-technical audience may be difficult.
> * Borrowing from existing literature, I sketch two answers to the question of the economic value of architecture: the return on investment metaphor and the selling options metaphor.

### Architecture in Product-Led Organizations: Learning From Customer-Centric Fields
> * When it comes to product development, I generally recommend two resources for architects: “Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value” by Melissa Perri and “Product Operations” by Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles. 
> * The build trap occurs when businesses focus too much on their product’s features and functionalities, overlooking customers’ needs and preferences.
> * Product Operations is the discipline of helping product management scales well, surrounding teams with essential inputs to set strategy, prioritize, and streamline ways of working.

### Decision Intelligence in IT Architecture: Learning From Data, Social, and Managerial Fields
> * Decision intelligence is the discipline of turning information into better actions.
> * A decision involves more than just selecting from available options; it represents a commitment of resources you

### How Big Transformations Get Done: Learning From Mega-Projects
> * IT transformation projects are large-scale, multi-year endeavors that often aim for significant organizational changes, such as creating unified IT platforms after mergers, and they frequently face challenges similar to other mega-projects.
> * Common cognitive biases and decision-making fallacies like overconfidence, strategic misrepresentation, and the sunk cost fallacy often derail these projects, leading to cost overruns, delays, and underperformance.
> * Flyvbjerg and Gardner’s book "How Big Things Get Done" highlights lessons from successful and failed mega-projects across various industries, offering 11 practical heuristics for improving project leadership, including hiring the right experts, building modular systems, and focusing on risk mitigation.
> * Key strategies for IT success include taking the outside view to learn from similar projects, fostering strong stakeholder relationships, and avoiding unnecessary complexity or scope creep by staying focused on core objectives.
